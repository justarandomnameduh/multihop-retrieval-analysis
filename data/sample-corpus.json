And as one former federal prosecutor put it: \u201cThe odds seem to be stacked against him at this point.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old co-founded FTX in 2019; within a few years the once third-largest crypto exchange\u2019s valuation hit $32 billion at its peak. It\u2019s now trying to claw back any funds to distribute to creditors.\n\nBut how did the once third-largest crypto exchange get here?\n\nBefore FTX, Bankman-Fried co-founded crypto-trading firm Alameda Research in 2017. He co-founded FTX in 2019 as a complement to Alameda, to help bring in revenue and liquidity for the trading arm.\n\nWithin two years, more than 80 investors provided about $2 billion in capital to FTX, helping Bankman-Fried propel his vision into a reality. In January 2022, the company raised $400 million in a Series C round, boosting its valuation to $32 billion. That was its last round of public funding.\n\nThe company gained somewhat mainstream recognition with branding deals and partnerships. For example, in 2021 it bought the naming rights for the Miami Heat\u2019s home arena. FTX also got its name branded on Major League Baseball umpires\u2019 polos, and it partnered with celebrities like Tom Brady and his ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, as well as Steph Curry, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Naomi Osaka, among others. He also had close ties to U.S. regulators and government officials, many of whom he donated to.\n\nBankman-Fried was even compared to Warren Buffet and many called him the white horse of crypto (TechCrunch never did, for what it\u2019s worth).\n\nBut in early November 2022, that all changed.\n\nFTX\u2019s collapse\n\nConcerns surrounding FTX\u2019s liquidity grew after CoinDesk published a copy of Alameda\u2019s balance sheet, showing the firm held $14.6 billion in assets and $8 billion in liabilities as of June 30, 2022.\n\nBut there was a problem: The report showed Alameda\u2019s largest asset was $3.66 billion of \u201cunlocked FTT\u201d and $2.16 billion of \u201cFTT collateral.\u201d FTT was the token behind FTX.\n\nThe balance sheet showed that the $5.82 billion in FTT tokens that Alameda owned was 193% higher than the total FTT market cap, which was about $3 billion at the time. That means it purported to have more FTT tokens on its balance sheet than what existed in the world.\n\nAround the same time it was exposed, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, started pulling out its remaining $2.1 billion equivalent of cash in BUSD and FTT. (It had an equity position in FTX from 2019 to 2021.) This essentially triggered a bank run on FTX.\n\nFTX and Alameda filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. mid-November 2022. Bankman-Fried resigned, and John J. Ray III, the Enron turnaround veteran, was appointed its new CEO.\n\nBankman-Fried, however, maintained his innocence. At The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit, he appeared virtually from the Bahamas, saying \u201cI didn\u2019t ever try to commit fraud on anyone; I was shocked by what happened this month.\u201d In a published DM exchange with a Vox reporter, he said he regretted filing for bankruptcy and thought that \u201cregulators make everything worse.\u201d\n\nSBF arrested\n\nBankman-Fried was arrested in December 2022 in the Bahamas, where FTX was based. He was then extradited to the U.S. to face a number of criminal charges. He was released on a $250 million bail bond, and he remained under house arrest at his parents\u2019 home in Palo Alto. This was revoked in August after he was accused of intimidating Alameda\u2019s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, by leaking her private diary.\n\nRay represented the company during a House Financial Services Committee hearing regarding FTX. When asked whether the firm had significant risk management systems, Ray said at the time that \u201cthere were virtually no internal controls and no separateness whatsoever\u201d and added that he did not \u201ctrust a single piece of paper\u201d in the exchange\u2019s organization. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams called Bankman-Fried\u2019s alleged crimes \u201cone of the biggest financial frauds in American history,\u201d in a press conference.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nFTX co-founder and former CTO Gary Wang, and Alameda Research\u2019s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, both pleaded guilty in December 2022 to federal criminal charges in relation to the FTX collapse. They\u2019re also facing civil penalties from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alongside the criminal charges. Wang and Ellison plan to cooperate with prosecutors and will be major witnesses in the trial, given their close ties to Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda.\n\nIn January, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to all counts, which include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to misuse customer funds. He could face up to 115 years in jail if convicted on all charges.\n\nThe crypto industry as a whole suffered from FTX\u2019s collapse, which was the first of many. BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 in November 2022, as did Genesis Global Trading in January.\n\nWhere we are today\n\nBankman-Fried will be represented by Cohen & Gresser, and Mark Cohen, a high-profile defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, will be the lead attorney. If that name sounds familiar, it might be because he also represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex trafficking trial related to Jeffrey Epstein. He requested an early release for Bankman-Fried but was denied.\n\nWith the trial beginning, we\u2019re witnessing how FTX\u2019s story ends. But what\u2019s on our mind is what happens to the investors and creditors affected by the collapse? And what happens to the billions in crypto assets tied up in legal proceedings?"}, {"title": "Sam Altman backs teens\u2019 startup, Google unveils the Pixel 8 and TikTok tests an ad-free tier", "author": "Kyle Wiggers", "source": "TechCrunch", "published_at": "2023-10-07T20:15:26+00:00", "category": "technology", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/07/sam-altman-backs-a-teens-startup-google-unveils-the-pixel-8-and-tiktok-tests-an-ad-free-tier/", "body": "Hiya, folks, and welcome to Week in Review (WiR), TechCrunch\u2019s digest of the past week in tech news.

Also on the agenda: Gmail\u2019s harsher rules to prevent spam, TikTok testing an ad-free subscription plan, and LinkedIn going big on AI tools.

Manish writes that Induced AI, founded this year, lets businesses input their back-office tasks in plain English and converts the instructions to pseudo-code in real time.\n\nGoogle unveils new hardware: This week was Google\u2019s annual hardware event, where the search and consumer tech giant showed off what it\u2019s been working on. Christine wrote up a thorough roundup of the news, which included updates on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, Android 14, Pixel Buds, Google Assistant, Bard, Pixel Watch 2 and other goodies.\n\nHands on with the Pixel 8 Pro: Darrell took the newly unveiled Pixel 8 Pro for a whirl, and he liked what he saw. While very similar to last year\u2019s model (the Pixel 7 Pro), Darrell felt that the improved cameras, brighter screen and enhanced AI-powered features made it enough of an upgrade to (potentially) warrant a purchase \u2014 minus the underutilized temperature sensor. Stay tuned for his full review.\n\nTurmoil at Flexport: Dave Clark, the former Amazon executive who was ousted as CEO of Flexport just a year into the job, fired back at its founder and board, calling recent reporting on the logistics company \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d Clark made the comments Monday in a lengthy post on social media site X following a report from CNBC that provided new information about his last days at Flexport, a freight forwarding and customs brokerage startup valued at $8 billion.\n\nSBF allegedly tried to buy off Trump: The TC team\u2019s been trained on the Manhattan Federal Court for the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced entrepreneur accused of orchestrating the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.

The company says that, starting next year, bulk senders will need to authenticate their emails, offer an easy way to unsubscribe and stay under a reported spam threshold.\n\nTikTok tests an ad-free tier: TikTok is testing an ad-free subscription tier for some users. For $4.99, subscribers get an ad-free experience on TikTok \u2014 no other strings attached. But don\u2019t look for the option to arrive anytime soon.

They include a big update to its Recruiter talent sourcing platform, with AI assistance built into it throughout; an AI-powered LinkedIn Learning coach; and a new AI-powered tool for marketing campaigns.\n\nMusk comes clean about X\u2019s metrics \u2014 maybe: In September, Elon Musk said that X users were generating a lot of content \u2014 creating 100 million to 200 million posts every day, excluding retweets. But speaking at an event this week, X CEO Linda Yaccarino offered a contradictory figure. She claimed X was seeing 500 million posts per day on the platform. So who\u2019s right? Beats us.\n\nFormer NSA director\u2019s startup shutters: IronNet, a once-promising cybersecurity startup founded by a former NSA director, has shuttered and laid off its remaining staff following its collapse. The Virginia-based IronNet was founded in 2014 by retired four-star general Keith Alexander and had raised more than $400 million in funding. But IronNet failed to gain traction after going public in August 2021, and its stock price continued to steeply decline in the wake of an initial spike.\n\nAudio\n\nOn the hunt for a new podcast to listen to while you work out, do the dishes or rake the leaves (now that fall\u2019s arrived)?

As a career-long academic, Rodriguez-Villegas talks about how she never intended to be a founder until she learned about how the currently available medical devices make it extremely difficult to detect and treat diseases like sleep apnea and epilepsy.\n\nAnd over on Chain Reaction, Jacquelyn did a crossover episode with Alex about the SBF trial. Jacquelyn has been on the ground at the Southern District of New York courthouse, listening in to the trial in the same room as Bankman-Fried, so there was lots to talk about.\n\nTechCrunch+\n\nTC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys \u2014 which you know if you\u2019re already a subscriber.

Even with a young roster and potential load management, Wembanyama's undeniable impact is evident.\n\nHis elite defense, highlighted by his 7-foot-4 height and 8-foot wingspan, allows him to dominate where others can't.

But you\u2019ll be doing so without much information that could be key in making an educated decision.\n\nConversely, if you wait for the data you need for an informed bet, the odds will tighten up, and you will see less of a return on your wager.\n\nWhen the lines are first released for NBA ROTY honors, the season hasn\u2019t even started yet, so there are no statistics, trends, or player news. The pre-season odds are so favorable because even the oddsmakers don\u2019t have the data to craft more specific lines.\n\nOnce the season has started and you get to see how the various rookies are performing, you can gather the relevant data. But sportsbooks are also gathering this information, and they begin to tighten the NBA Rookie of the Year lines in response.\n\nSo, while you can better guess which player will hoist the Wilt Chamberlain Trophy, the odds will be tighter, and your potential return on your wager will be reduced.\n\nPros and cons of betting early on the NBA Rookie of the Year:\n\nPros:\n\nYou have an opportunity to find better value.\n\nThe betting odds are fresh and haven't been adjusted.\n\nCons:\n\nThere is a much higher risk as a player's performance, health, and team dynamic can change throughout the season.\n\nYou\u2019ll find limited information to make an informed bet.\n\nPros and cons of waiting to bet on the NBA Rookie of the Year:\n\nPros:\n\nThere is a lot more information available to make an informed bet.\n\nYou don\u2019t risk betting on a player not remotely in contention.\n\nCons:\n\nThere is a reduced opportunity to find value.\n\nThe odds may not be as favorable.\n\nKeep in mind that it\u2019s always important to take into consideration your risk tolerance while you weigh the potential rewards. No matter when you decide to make your wager, always gather as much information as possible before risking your hard-earned money.\n\nWho are the past NBA ROTY winners?\n\nFor context, here is a list of the National Basketball Association Rookie of the Year winners since 2010.\n\nSeason Player Position Team 2023 Paolo Banchero Forward Orlando Magic 2022 Scottie Barnes Forward Toronto Raptors 2021 LaMelo Ball Guard Charlotte Hornets 2020 Ja Morant Guard Memphis Grizzlies 2019 Luka Don\u010di\u0107 Guard/Forward Dallas Mavericks 2018 Ben Simmons Forward/Guard Philadelphia 76ers 2017 Malcolm Brogdon Guard Milwaukee Bucks 2016 Karl-Anthony Towns Center Minnesota Timberwolves 2015 Andrew Wiggins Forward/Guard Minnesota Timberwolves 2014 Michael Carter-Williams Guard Philadelphia 76ers 2013 Damian Lillard Guard Portland Trail Blazers 2012 Kyrie Irving Guard Cleveland Cavaliers 2011 Blake Griffin Forward Los Angeles Clippers 2010 Tyreke Evans Guard/Forward Sacramento Kings\n\nWhat other NBA futures can I bet on?\n\nRookie of the Year is not the only form of NBA futures betting. Legal online sportsbooks have a wide selection of NBA futures you can bet on, including:\n\nIn addition to futures bets, you can wager on many NBA bets during the regular season and postseason. NBA game lines (moneylines, point spreads, and totals) are the most popular, but you\u2019ll also be able to bet on NBA team and player props, parlays, and more.\n\nThe NBA is the second-most popular odds market to bet on in the US, behind NFL betting odds.

On March 31, 2023, Kentucky became the 34th state to legalize sports betting and the 25th with online/mobile access. Retail locations opened on September 7 and Kentucky online sports betting became legal on September 28.\n\nThe betting menu for Kentuckians is exhaustive in that they are able to legally wager on all major professional, collegiate and international sports, unlike other sports betting states. With excitement building among customers in the state for Kentucky sports gambling, it's feasible that Kentucky generates over $1 billion in Kentucky sports betting handle by the end of 2023.\n\nKentucky Sportsbook Apps to Know\n\nSportsbook Platforms App Features* Fanatics iOS and Android apps FanCash Rewards, bettable search, Discover page, cash outs, easy sign up, secure deposit, Withdrawal Tracker FanDuel iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web Quick bets, secure deposits, horse racing, casino, cash outs, fast payouts DraftKings iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web\n\nCasino, fast withdrawals, secure deposits BetMGM iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web\n\nEasy deposits and withdrawals, 24/7 access, safe and secure transactions Caesars iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web\n\nCaesars Rewards, casino, Quick Picks Bet365 iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web\n\nCash outs, personalized display, alerts, edit bets, My Teams, search, sports stats\n\nSports Betting on Kentucky (and Nearby) Teams\n\nKentucky Wildcats: One of the most iconic college basketball programs in the nation, the Kentucky Wildcats should be an extremely popular betting option for Bluegrass State residents. The eight-time national champions have been led by legendary coach John Calipari since 2010 and they have appeared in four Final Fours during his tenure, recording a national title in 2012. The program's 2,021-637 all-time record is the best in college basketball history. Though best known for its basketball prowess, Kentucky has also found more success on the gridiron in recent years in the SEC, including a dozen bowl appearances since 2006.\n\nLouisville Cardinals: The Wildcats have the historic edge, but Louisville basketball won the more recent national title, cutting down the nets in 2013. They've been to 10 Final Fours and own the 12th-best record (1,726-874) in college basketball history. Louisville has also become a bigger name in the college football world in the past couple decades. Well known for 2013 Heisman winner Lamar Jackson, Louisville transitioned to the ACC in 2014 and the Cardinals have finished in the AP Top 25 seven times since 2004.\n\nWestern Kentucky Hilltoppers: Though they don't have the widespread following of UK or Louisville, the Hilltoppers have a nice fanbase in the southern portion of the state and they have the overall athletic success to demand attention in the betting market. A longtime Division I-AA (now known as FCS) power, WKU fully transitioned to the FBS level in 2009 and they've had nine winning seasons since that point. In men's basketball, WKU has made the NCAA Tournament 23 times and its 1,622-720 all-time mark ranks 14th in history, just a couple spots behind Louisville.\n\nCincinnati Bengals: With no \"Big Four\" professional sports teams playing within state lines, many Kentucky residents look just north of the state's border to cheer on the neighboring Cincinnati Bengals. A franchise long known for its futility in the early days of existence became more of a contender under Marvin Lewis with seven playoff appearances between 2005-15. The franchise got another jolt more recently with stars such as Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase leading Cincinnati to a Super Bowl appearance in 2021 and an AFC title game appearance in 2022. The Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans are also NFL franchises located within short drives of portions of Kentucky.\n\nCincinnati Reds: The state's MLB allegiances are a bit more split with the St. Louis Cardinals also drawing a big following, particularly in the western portion of the state, but the Reds are largely considered the most popular team for Kentucky residents. The Reds won modern-era titles in 1975, 1976 and 1990, but haven't advanced past the NLCS since that point. They've largely struggled in recent years, but the 2023 team has pushed for a playoff spot all season, just in time to draw the attention of new Kentucky sports bettors.\n\nTop Kentucky betting terms for new bettors\n\nAgainst the spread: Instead of betting on an exact winner, the widely-popular spread bet levels the playing field by allowing you to wager on how many points a team will win by. In basketball, if Kentucky is the 7.5-point favorite against Louisville then Kentucky can cover the spread if it wins by 8 or more points. However, Louisville as the 7.5-point underdog can cover the spread by winning outright or losing by 7 or fewer points.\n\nMoney line: Think of this as an elevated outright bet, with odds adjusted to reflect a favored team and an underdog. If Kentucky is listed as a -200 favorite against Florida, you'd need to bet $200 to return $100 on Kentucky to win. That means that Florida as the +200 underdog would return $200 on a $100 bet if that team wins.\n\nOutright bet: This is the easiest wager that can be placed, and it's perfect for betting on one of Kentucky's biggest sporting events: Horse racing. With an outright bet, bettors choose one athlete -- or thoroughbred -- to win an entire sporting event.\n\nOver/Under: If team sports is more your thing, placing an Over/Under bet is the way to go. Kentucky sportsbooks will post an estimated total of both team's final scores in a game, and you wager on whether the actual final will be higher or lower than the estimate. So if the If the Over/Under for a Kentucky vs. Louisville basketball game is 125.5, you would wager on the final total being Over 126 or Under 125.\n\nPlayer prop: Kentucky is one of the 18 states that allows you to place prop bets on collegiate athletes. Sportsbooks will project what a player's stat will be at the end of a game, and you will wager whether the player will end that game over or under that projection. Popular player props include how many touchdown passes a quarterback will throw or how many three-point shots a basketball player will hit.\n\nUnderdog: The underdog is the team deemed less likely to win the game based on the odds. A bet on an underdog typically yields a larger return than a bet on the favorite.\n\nFavorite: On the other hand, a favorite is the team that is deemed more likely to win the game. Bettors often pay a premium for betting on a favorite but they're also the team that more often wins the game outright.\n\nConsensus odds: These odds are generally defined as an average of all available betting markets. Different sportsbooks may price markets variably based on the action they've taken or their own interpretation of information.\n\nFutures: While money line, against the spread and over/under bets are all single-game bets, futures markets encompass almost anything that falls outside of that spectrum. Futures bets include total regular-season wins, championship odds, MVP odds and more.\n\nParlay: This popular betting style is a little more complex. A parlay requires you to include two or more bets within a single wager, and all of your bets must win for the parlay to be a winner. For example, if you wager $100 on a three-leg parlay at 6 to 1 odds, you could win $600 if all three legs of the bet are winners.\n\nJuice: Also known as \"The Vig\" or vigorish, juice is effectively the tax that oddsmakers charge for handling a wager. If a book determines a game is a virtual coinflip, they may price both options at -110 to give themselves a 10% rake on all the action.\n\nPush: A push is a bet where neither the bettor or the sportsbook wins. If an over/under for total points in a football game is set at 44 and both teams combine to score exactly 44 points, the result is a push and the principle is returned to the bettor.\n\nLive/in-game betting: Many sportsbooks now offer live/in-game wagering that allows you to make bets on several different markets in real-time. In basketball, you can bet on the outcome of a quarter, individual statistics and live-updated spreads/totals.\n\nYou can bet on sports in states like Ohio, New York, and Arizona."}, {"title": "Vermont Sportsbook Promos and Sports Betting Launch News", "author": "Martin Harris", "source": "Sporting News", "published_at": "2023-09-26T22:53:28+00:00", "category": "sports", "url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/us/betting/news/vermont-sportsbook-promos/b4779ea9b7172cc57a201b0f", "body": "The best sports betting sites in the country are focused on Vermont where the launch of legal online sports betting is now scheduled for January 2024.

And with the $100 in Bonus Bets for those signing up by Jan. 10, the offer is even more generous.\n\nDraftKings Vermont promo code\n\nDraftKings is likewise already known to Vermont sports fans thanks to its popular DFS site, and many will surely be gravitating to the DraftKings Sportsbook as well. DraftKings also has a prelive offer already available to Vermont users.

The deposit match bonus offer is unique as well, although not all new users will likely try to take advantage of it.\n\nBetMGM Vermont promo code\n\nKnown as the \u201cKing of Sportsbooks,\u201d BetMGM Sportbook is another favorite around the US and will surely be one should it launch in Vermont.

If you want to receive The Interchange directly in your inbox every Sunday, head here to sign up! After a bit of a quiet period, things in the world of fintech picked up in a big way this past week. We wrote about some notable fundraises, how PayPal was hit with an antitrust lawsuit, how Bolt is trying to move on after an SEC probe, and much more.\n\nRainforest takes on the bigger players\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that we\u2019re pitched companies that feel like they are taking on bigger players in a really meaningful way. This past week, I wrote about Rainforest, an Atlanta-based startup that is taking on incumbents such as Fiserv and FIS, as well as trying to take market share from other fintechs such as Stripe with its offering. Rainforest works with software companies to help them embed financial services and payments into their platforms. In an interview with TechCrunch, CEO and co-founder Joshua Silver respectfully disagreed with a16z general partner Angela Strange about her 2019 statement that every company would become a fintech. In his view, most software companies don\u2019t actually want to be fintechs and deal with all the regulatory and compliance issues that go with that. They really just want to be able to accept payments and generate more revenue from being able to do so.\n\nAccel led the company\u2019s $8.5 million seed round, which included participation from Infinity Ventures, BoxGroup, The Fintech Fund, Tech Square Ventures, and Ardent Venture Partners.\n\nIt\u2019s always cool to see startups outside the coasts growing, and Silver\u2019s confidence that what Rainforest is building will make it a formidable player in the space feels like it has merit. Founded in 2022, the startup has seen impressive growth in a short period of time, securing client commitments representing more than $500 million in processing, with much of the volume guaranteed.\n\nSilver believes the company\u2019s exclusive focus on software companies only gives it an edge.\n\n\u201cNone of the modern processors were built specifically for software platforms. Most of them were built directly for merchants, and they\u2019ve all had to retrofit their platforms even to accommodate basic payment processing and reporting functions for software companies,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\nAs such, the startup is capturing volume as software platforms migrate from legacy processors such as Fiserv and FIS. As that happens, it competes against companies like Stripe (and its Connect product) to embed financial services and payments.\n\nNik Milanovi\u0107 of The Fintech Fund posted on X that he believes that one of the biggest stories of the next decade will be about Stripe, \u201cwhich looks invincible from the outside, losing market share to nimble competitors.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think Rainforest is going to be a big part of that story.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Infinity Ventures\u2019 Jeremy Jonker and former PayPal exec said he\u2019s been in payments for 13 years and has \u201cnever before seen anything like Rainforest.\u201d He told me via email that \u201cJoshua\u2019s background as a software platform founder and then as a payments consultant is a big part of the secret sauce. He\u2019s lived the pain of payments himself, and you can\u2019t underestimate the power of being in your clients\u2019 shoes. He knew that taking on risk and compliance burdens, and offering features like data portability, would be hugely attractive to platforms. We also like that it\u2019s not just him who has a wealth of payments experience \u2014 it\u2019s the entire team he\u2019s recruited to the company. Many are longtime payments and SaaS vets who knew there was so much potential for a better provider, and now they\u2019ve built it themselves.\u201d\n\nListen to TC+ editor Alex Wilhelm and I talk more about how there\u2019s plenty of market share to go around in Friday\u2019s episode of the Equity podcast below. \u2014 Mary Ann\n\nPayPal is being sued for alleged \u201cDraconian\u201d payment policies\n\nOn October 5, Mary Ann broke the news that PayPal has been hit with a class action lawsuit by consumers represented by law firm Hagens Berman alleging that the fintech giant\u2019s anti-steering rules stifle competition against lower-cost payment platforms such as Stripe and Shopify. Specifically, according to an investigation conducted by the firm\u2019s consumer rights attorneys, PayPal has subjected consumers to excess charges when purchasing from online merchants that accept PayPal or Venmo.\n\nSomeone commented on social media that they didn\u2019t see the problem with what PayPal is doing and questioned whether or not Visa and Mastercard do the same thing. So I went back to the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, who noted that the \u201canti-steering rules\u201d are not the first of their kind. They said: \u201cVisa and MasterCard once imposed similar anti-steering rules on merchants accepting their cards but, after the Justice Department sued the networks for antitrust violations, they agreed in 2010 to eliminate their anti-steering rules as part of the settlement. With payments transitioning into the digital realm, PayPal has simply ripped a page right from the Visa and MasterCard [sic] playbook.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Patrick McGahan, a partner at Scott+Scott who focuses on antitrust litigation, had an interesting take that actually involves both of those card giants. He told TechCrunch that the case illustrates that \u201cthe tensions between merchants and the payment system providers are not over, and that litigation regarding this key cost faced by merchants is likely to continue for some time.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cPlatform companies that operate as gatekeepers in their market, such as PayPal, will continue to be the subject of antitrust litigation as a result of the significant fees they charge. PayPal\u2019s fees are, however, driven by the costs imposed upon them by the dominant card schemes, Visa, Mastercard and American Express. So, we can expect PayPal will respond to this suit by arguing that it is as much of a price taker as the merchants themselves, and that the terms imposed upon it by the card schemes drive some of its anti-steering rules.\u201d\n\nPayPal did not respond to requests for comment. \u2014 Mary Ann\n\nBolt CEO gets frank about SEC probe\n\nBolt Financial CEO Maju Kuruvilla told me in an interview that the one-click checkout company is putting a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe behind it and is moving on.\n\n\u201cIt obviously is a very, very involved process, but we\u2019re really happy to put that behind us,\u201d Kuruvilla told TechCrunch. \u201cWe look forward to focusing on the momentum for the business and how we can help the retailers, especially the big retailers who are looking to us to innovate for them, because this is a tough year for retailers.\u201d\n\nYou might remember that Bolt, which provides checkout technology to merchants, and its co-founder Ryan Breslow, were subpoenaed last year by the SEC to investigate whether the company violated any securities laws during fundraising in 2021 when Bolt was seeking its $355 million Series E round that valued the company at $11 billion.\n\nThe investigation took about 15 months, but news of that probe didn\u2019t go public until July of 2023. Shortly thereafter on August 23, the SEC said, in a letter viewed by TechCrunch, it was not recommending an enforcement action for the company.\n\nKuruvilla spoke with me about how, exactly, the company can put something like this behind it, what it told customers and what\u2019s next.

It\u2019s powered by Falun Gong, a religious group persecuted in China, which launched The Epoch Times as a free propaganda newsletter more than two decades ago to oppose the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nFunded through aggressive online and real-world marketing campaigns and big-money conservative donors, The Epoch Times now boasts to be the country\u2019s fourth-largest newspaper by subscriber count. (Unlike most major newspapers, The Epoch Times isn't audited by the two major independent collectors of circulation data.) The nonprofit has amassed a fortune, growing its revenue by a staggering 685% in two years, to $122 million in 2021, according to the group\u2019s most recent tax records.\n\nIts editorial vision \u2014 fueled by a right-wing slant and conspiracy theories \u2014 is on display in recent reports on how \u201cJan. 6 Capitol Hill Security Footage Challenges Key Narratives\u201d and \u201cMeteorologists, Scientists Explain Why There Is \u2018No Climate Emergency.\u2019\u201d Its video series include a documentary-style film alleging widespread vaccine injury and death and an expos\u00e9 of an alleged world government agenda to harm farmers, cull the population and force survivors to eat bugs.\n\nWhat The Epoch Times lacks in standards, it makes up for in style and form, mirroring the aesthetics of journalism \u2014 a feature that\u2019s attracted subscribers and big-name supporters.\n\nAnti-vaccine activist and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. calls The Epoch Times a daily read, among his most trusted news sources. \u201cThey have a real bias against China, but on other reporting, they\u2019re very courageous and it\u2019s real journalism,\u201d Kennedy said in an interview with NBC News this summer.\n\nIn July, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., recited the history of The Epoch Times into the congressional record. \u201cThis is all about one word: freedom,\u201d Norman said.\n\nThe Epoch Times has yet to throw its weight behind a candidate for 2024, but heading into the election cycle, it is moving into new and bigger office spaces and production studios in California, hiring mainstream news veterans who are not affiliated with Falun Gong, and revving up an ad-buying blitz.\n\n\u201cThey achieved the goal,\u201d said Brendan Steinhauser, a Texas-based Republican strategist hired by The Epoch Times in 2018 to open doors to conservative politicians and players. Steinhauser said that a series of interviews and introductions with politicians and media figures at that year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference offered access to a wider conservative audience. The Epoch Times was a \u201csupporting sponsor\u201d for this year\u2019s conference.\n\n\u201cThey take advantage of every opportunity,\u201d Steinhauser, who is not currently working for The Epoch Times, continued. \u201cThey studied digital marketing. They learned how to work the system. And they did it. They're smarter than people give them credit for, and they\u2019ve got the money to back it up.\u201d\n\nAs a nonprofit, The Epoch Times is exempt from most federal taxes. Its mission, according to tax filings, is independent journalism, \u201coutside of political interests and the pursuit of profit, for the public benefit and to be truly responsible to society.\u201d\n\nNeither the chairman nor the editor-in-chief of The Epoch Times returned multiple requests for comment. Representatives for The Epoch Times have previously defended it against critical reporting, labeling reports of the paper\u2019s conservative mission, and its penchant for misinformation, \u201csmears.\u201d\n\nEpoch Times representatives also deny an affiliation with Falun Gong, despite the two groups\u2019 clear financial and organizational ties: The Epoch Times board members and most staff are Falun Gong practitioners. The nonprofits behind The Epoch Times and Friends of Falun Gong, the movement\u2019s advocacy organization, share executives and provide grants and services to each other, according to tax filings. And the newspaper, along with a digital production company and the heavily advertised dance troupe Shen Yun, make up a nonprofit network that the leader of the religious movement calls \u201cour media.\u201d\n\nLi Hongzhi during an interview in New York in 1999. Henny Ray Abrams / AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn 2009, Li Hongzhi came to speak to his followers, volunteers who worked at The Epoch Times\u2019 offices in Manhattan. Li\u2019s instructions for the group were simple. They needed to reach people outside of the Falun Gong religious community. And they needed to make money. A lot of it.\n\n\u201cEnsure that the paper gains a foothold in ordinary society and turns profitable,\u201d Li said.\n\nFalun Gong \u2014 or Falun Dafa, as some followers call it \u2014 is a kind of personal development movement started by Li in China in 1992. It combines tenets of Buddhism and Taoism, and followers practice with meditation and flowing breath and movement exercises, and by studying Li\u2019s teachings.\n\nTo his followers, Li is a God-like figure who can levitate, walk through walls and see into the future. His ultra-conservative and controversial teachings include a rejection of modern science, art and medicine, and a denunciation of homosexuality, feminism and general worldliness.\n\nIn 1999, after thousands of Li\u2019s followers silently protested its repression in Beijing, China banned it altogether. Labeling it a cult, the Chinese government confiscated Falun Gong books, blocked websites, closed teaching centers and arrested practitioners. Human rights groups reported a brutal crackdown: Some adherents were sent to labor camps; others were tortured and killed.\n\nFalun Gong followers meditate outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington in 1999. Joyce Naltchayan / AFP via Getty Images file\n\nInternational human rights organizations condemned China\u2019s attempted eradication. In the U.S., where Li and some of his practitioners had fled, a new collection of followers organized a campaign to raise awareness and sympathy with parades, demonstrations and pamphlets that touted the benefits of Falun Gong and the brutality of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nThe Epoch Times was born out of that leafleting campaign. Started in Georgia in 2000 by John Tang, a Falun Gong practitioner who remains its CEO, in essence it was a Chinese-language public relations newsletter. The group\u2019s long-term goals were ambitious: to expose the Chinese Communist Party and to save the world in a supernatural war against communism.\n\nThrough the early aughts, The Epoch Times grew from an online effort to a weekly physical newspaper, with a home base in New York and a TV production company, New Tang Dynasty Television. It raised money from followers and was staffed by unpaid volunteers. It ran aggregated articles on international issues from Voice of America next to Thanksgiving Day explainers, dispatches from Falun Gong parades, and expos\u00e9s on atrocities alleged to have been committed by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nBy 2019, it had gone mostly digital and was spending millions of dollars on creating a network of Facebook pages and groups and running aggressive pro-Trump ad campaigns. The move toward explicit support of Republicans, despite Li\u2019s teachings to stay away from U.S. politics, was foreshadowed by Li\u2019s comments at a Falun Gong conference a year before.\n\nLi said that Falun Gong\u2019s media ought to put a \u201cconstructive\u201d spin on the news, to advance the group\u2019s aims. It wasn\u2019t wrong, he said, to favorably cover a politician who shared Falun Gong\u2019s conservative values and whose goals aligned with their own.\n\n\u201cIf someone comes along now who can help to halt the downward spiral that the world is in, then he is truly someone extraordinary!\u201d Li said. \u201cHe would in effect be helping us! Wouldn\u2019t he be helping us to save people?\u201d\n\nThe Epoch Times also employed a tactic more often associated with fake news content farms and scammers than news organizations, creating a network of inspiring and cute-content pages and fake accounts to inflate The Epoch Times' reach.\n\nIn 2019, following reporting by NBC News, Facebook found that The Epoch Times had \u201cleveraged foreign actors posing as Americans to push political content\u201d and banned it from future advertising, citing a violation of policies, including trying to circumvent review systems.\n\nUndeterred, The Epoch Times pivoted to video, specifically YouTube, spending millions on internet-infamous ads featuring Roman Balmakov, a former Epoch Times delivery person who now hosts the online show Facts Matter. In the ads, Balmakov rails against the mainstream media, communism and the persecution of Trump.\n\nThe Epoch Times also revisited a tried-and-true strategy that the original anti-communism newspaper had been built on \u2014 free physical copies. Instead of boxes on street corners, this time The Epoch Times printed and distributed unsolicited special editions of the paper from California to the Carolinas to the U.K. In Philadelphia alone in 2020, the company mailed 280,000 free copies of its newspaper, \u201cto increase subscription,\u201d according to tax documents.\n\nThe aggressive online and real-life marketing campaigns paid off. The group reported $76 million in subscription revenue in 2021, compared to nearly $7 million in 2019. A former employee of a regional Epoch Times operation who asked not to be identified because he feared retribution said that in order to send the papers to the most likely customers, they bought lists of addresses from data brokers, specifically for conservatives aged 60 and over. And many of the new subscribers are seniors, according to an employee\u2019s account shared at a Falun Gong conference.\n\nBut hundreds of online complaints suggest that not all of the new customers are satisfied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the terrible misfortune of being subscribed to the Epoch Times without my consent,\u201d one reads. Another says: \u201cI want to stop receiving Epoch Times emails. That is all I want.\u201d\n\nThe Epoch Times print newspaper in Augusta, Ga., in 2020. Elijah Nouvelage / Bloomberg via Getty Images file\n\nAs The Epoch Times\u2019 marketing strategy shifted, so did the content \u2014 and by 2020, it became a megaphone for the U.S.\u2019s most extreme right-wing stories.\n\nThere was plenty to write about: An election marred by disinformation, the bubbling culture wars and, most helpful for a media company missioned with ending the Chinese Communist Party, a pandemic originating from China provided endless opportunities for takes that aligned with hawkish conservatives and conspiracy theorists.\n\nThe Epoch Times was early to lay blame on China for Covid \u2014 labeling it the \u201cCCP Virus\u201d in its coverage. (The origin of the outbreak is unknown; the best evidence still points to natural transmission from an animal market.) China\u2019s documented handling of the virus, including withholding information from researchers, a crackdown on whistleblowers and an authoritarian public health response, added credibility to The Epoch Times\u2019 unproven claims.\n\n\u201cThe dynamic for The Epoch Times changed in 2020, partly because of their criticism of China around Covid,\u201d said A.J. Bauer, an assistant journalism professor at the University of Alabama who studies conservative media. \u201cAn entire new kind of ecosystem of Covid deniers and skeptics overlapped with right-wing media and were citing and drawing heavily upon The Epoch Times.\u201d\n\nThe Epoch Times\u2019 subscription page began hosting glowing testimonials from Steve Bannon, Glenn Beck and the far-right Arizona congressman Paul Gosar. The organization became a reliable source for misinformation around Covid, its treatments and the vaccines.\n\nThe Epoch Times was also an early and aggressive promoter of election misinformation, according to the Election Integrity Partnership, a coalition of researchers that documented misinformation and the 2020 vote. The group cited the news organization as a \u201crepeat spreader\u201d of false and misleading voter fraud stories as well as a major promoter of debunked conspiracy theories around Dominion voting machines and the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement, aimed at overturning the election results. Months after the election, The Epoch Times refused to acknowledge the results.\n\nWith the new bedfellows came a new revenue stream. Though Falun Gong practitioners had been a reliable source of small donations in previous years, in 2020 the group started to receive gifts and grants from big money conservative donors.\n\nWhile The Epoch Times is not required to list its donors, it reported $8.4 million in revenue from contributions and grants in 2020 and 2021. Tax documents from that period filed by scores of donors, accessed through ProPublica\u2019s nonprofit explorer, show some of those funds came from conservative donors and foundations.\n\nIn 2021, The Epoch Times received $55,750 from the National Christian Charitable Foundation, which connects anonymous donors with Christian causes, and $31,000 from Donors Trust, a fund for conservative and libertarian donors. Smaller donations came from individuals \u2014 real estate agents, investors and surgeons among them \u2014 and small family foundations, most of which support right-wing causes, including evangelical Christian groups, anti-vaccine groups and far-right media organizations.\n\nMost of the donors contacted by NBC News did not respond to interview requests; two declined.\n\nThe Epoch Times is pouring its revenue back into its own organization and others connected to the Falun Gong religious movement.\n\nIn the first half of this year, The Epoch Times spent 65% more on ads than in the first six months of 2022, with about half of its budget going to the X platform, formerly Twitter, according to the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Other recent ad buys were made on the right-wing sites Drudge Report, Breitbart and Rumble.\n\nThe Epoch Times paid a company called Data Managing Corporation $2.7 million for advertising services in 2021, according to tax documents.

Depending on what evidence is introduced during the trial, it could be rough for the entire crypto industry.\n\n\u201cHow much damage can this trial do to the already beaten-down reputation of the industry at this point?\u201d asks Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThis trial is going to be an excruciating moment for the industry because no one knows what kind of evidence might come out.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and Alameda Research, is facing seven counts of criminal charges: two counts of wire fraud, and five counts of conspiracy charges. FTX was a failed cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2019. According to a now-deleted profile from FTX investors Sequoia Capital, FTX was founded because of Bankman-Fried\u2019s frustration with other exchanges when he was running Alameda Research, his crypto trading firm. According to the SEC, FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d diverting customers\u2019 funds to Alameda.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges \u2014 with a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.\u201d Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\n\n\u201cReally just old-fashioned embezzlement.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s left of FTX is now being led by John J. Ray III \u2014 you may remember him as the guy who cleaned up Enron and who also said FTX is worse than Enron. Just before the trial began, the FTX lawyers filed suit against Bankman-Fried\u2019s parents, saying they should give back millions of dollars they got from their kid. Ray has also referred to Bankman-Fried\u2019s conduct as \u201creally just old-fashioned embezzlement.\u201d\n\nWe have some inkling of what the government will be arguing thanks to the filings prosecutors are making in this case. They argue that Bankman-Fried lied about consumer protection and that Bankman-Fried\u2019s statements that FTX was \u201cavoiding or managing conflicts of interest\u201d and that \u201cas a general principle FTX segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms\u201d were lies, in a superseding indictment filed August 14th.\n\nThe indictment also says that there were special features in FTX\u2019s code that \u201cpermitted Alameda to spend and withdraw unlimited amounts of money from FTX,\u201d which were created at Bankman-Fried\u2019s direction. That effectively exempted Alameda from the kinds of risk management other customers faced. At the same time, the government alleges, \u201cBankman-Fried publicly and repeatedly asserted that Alameda did not have privileged access to FTX.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried is accused of using \u201cbillions of dollars in misappropriated FTX customer deposits\u201d to help buy more than $200 million of real estate for himself, make billions of dollars of investments for his own interest, and repay Alameda\u2019s lenders, according to the indictment, Additionally, Bankman-Fried allegedly used more than $100 million of customer funds to make political contributions; prosecutors can show evidence of those contributions in this trial, even though they aren\u2019t part of the charges brought. A second trial is scheduled for March 2024, with additional charges.\n\nBefore his fall, Bankman-Fried made himself out to be the Good Boy of crypto \u2014 the trustworthy face of a sometimes-shady industry. He was also very interested in publicity, sitting for many interviews both before and after the fall of FTX. The quick rise of FTX as an industry force was at least in part due to Bankman-Fried\u2019s appetite for attention. Here are the hits:\n\nBankman-Fried gave interviews freely \u2014 and quickly rose to public prominence in the industry. Though FTX hadn\u2019t been in the business as long as competing exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Gemini, Bankman-Fried positioned himself as an important, boyish face for crypto. (At one point, Bankman-Fried told a colleague at FTX that \u201cI honestly think it\u2019s negative EV [this may mean \u201cexpected value,\u201d as in poker] for me to cut my hair. I think it\u2019s important for people to think I look crazy.\u201d)\n\nBecause he was so successful at this kind of public relations, his fall from grace was another mark against an industry that was already roiled by bankruptcies and scandals. Some additional trouble for the crypto industry is likely to come from one crucial element of the fraud trial \u2014 the part where the government must prove intent.\n\nThe first part of proving the government\u2019s case is pretty simple and a little boring: prosecutors must show that certain transactions took place. Whatever records the Southern District of New York has for the transactions will be shown.\n\n\u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\n\nThe second part is where all the drama is likely to come, says Christopher LaVigne, a litigation partner and co-chair of the cryptocurrency practice at the law firm Withers. Prosecutors have to connect those transactions to Bankman-Fried, show that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and prove that he lied about it anyway.\n\n\u201cWhat was he saying to his parents and his other advisors about this?\u201d LaVigne says. \u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\n\nTo further establish intent, the government can use Bankman-Fried\u2019s own words. The indictment calls Bankman-Fried\u2019s tweets in November 2022 \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had him going out directly to the internet,\u201d LaVigne says. If he wrote things on Twitter or said things in interviews that weren\u2019t true, that\u2019s more fodder for the government\u2019s case. \u201cThey can point to that and say, \u2018This is what he said, this is what actually happened.\u2019\u201d\n\nOther evidence may include Signal messages and testimony from co-conspirators who plead guilty to their own charges. Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, who was also sometimes Bankman-Fried\u2019s girlfriend, may play an important role \u2014 Bankman-Fried leaked her diaries to The New York Times and was consequently jailed for witness tampering. The government has indicated FTX co-founder Gary Wang and engineering head Nishad Singh will also be among the witnesses called to give testimony about Bankman-Fried.\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him\n\nThere may be testimony from lenders, venture capitalists, and customers in order to establish the basis for some charges. In the indictment, the prosecutors allege that Bankman-Fried lied to FTX investors. Some of those investors may be called on to testify, which is not the kind of thing VC big shots generally enjoy \u2014 and which might create collateral damage for the industry.\n\nIf, for instance, Sequoia Capital did due diligence around its investment in FTX, whatever Bankman-Fried told its partners could be important. Was FTX already sending Alameda customer funds at that point? Did Bankman-Fried know about it? And did he tell VCs at the time? (If he told them it wasn\u2019t happening, that would establish intent.) Binance was also an early investor in FTX, and former executives may be called on to testify as well, says Hermine Wong, the former head of policy at Coinbase and a former SEC regulator.\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him. Defense lawyers have several simultaneous objectives. First and foremost, they\u2019re trying to prove their client is not guilty. But just in case they don\u2019t get the outcome they want, they\u2019re also laying the groundwork for appeals and sentencing arguments. Any piece of evidence they want to introduce for those two purposes has to come into play in the trial.\n\nAlready, Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers are marking arguments that his constitutional rights are being violated by his pretrial incarceration because, among other things, his internet connection wasn\u2019t good enough for him to plan his defense, notes LaVigne. That could be grounds for an appeal.\n\n\u201cIs he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s behavior after the fall of FTX suggests he\u2019s something of a wild card. He may suggest he was acting on the advice of his lawyers. But he may also introduce other evidence that could be troublesome \u2014 implying, for instance, that he was engaged in standard industry behavior or that everything that happened was Binance\u2019s fault. That may be risky, but we already know that Bankman-Fried loves risk.\n\n\u201cIs he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?\u201d Wong asks. \u201cAn idea like, \u2018Everyone was doing this, it\u2019s not fair I\u2019m the only one who was charged?\u2019\u201d That may not fly in a court of law, but it could absolutely damage public perception of crypto at large.\n\nFor instance, just before he was arrested, Bankman-Fried brought forward messages from a crypto group chat in testimony he planned to give before Congress. In that testimony, he primarily blames Binance and his lawyers at the firm Sullivan & Cromwell.\n\nIt\u2019s possible other messages from group chats may be brought into evidence during the trial. That can potentially be embarrassing for the whole industry, Wong says.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine some of these founders, CEOs, people of that echelon talk to each other somewhat informally about what\u2019s going on,\u201d she says. If it seems like his peer group supported him, or worse, fawned over him, that\u2019s a real problem for the industry\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n\nAfter FTX declared bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried went on an extensive media tour, doing interviews with The New York Times\u2019 Andrew Ross Sorkin and Good Morning America. Even under house arrest, he did interviews, including with The New Yorker. Bankman-Fried seemed to think that if he just explained things, everyone would understand that what he did was a mistake, not a crime."}, {"title": "OpenAI's ex-chairman accuses board of going rogue in firing Altman: 'Sam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did'", "author": "Matt O'Brien, The Associated Press", "source": "Fortune", "published_at": "2023-11-18T15:33:09+00:00", "category": "business", "url": "https://fortune.com/2023/11/18/how-did-openai-fire-sam-altman-greg-brockman-rogue-board/", "body": "ChatGPT-maker Open AI said Friday it has pushed out its co-founder and CEO Sam Altman after a review found he was \u201cnot consistently candid in his communications\u201d with the board of directors.\n\n\u201cThe board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI,\u201d the artificial intelligence company said in a statement.\n\nIn the year since Altman catapulted ChatGPT to global fame, he has become Silicon Valley\u2019s sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of artificial intelligence and his sudden and mostly unexplained exit brought uncertainty to the industry\u2019s future.\n\nMira Murati, OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer, will take over as interim CEO effective immediately, the company said, while it searches for a permanent replacement.\n\nThe announcement also said another OpenAI co-founder and top executive, Greg Brockman, the board\u2019s chairman, would step down from that role but remain at the company, where he serves as president. But later on X, formerly Twitter, Brockman posted a message he sent to OpenAI employees in which he wrote, \u201cbased on today\u2019s news, i quit.\u201d\n\nIn another X post on Friday night, Brockman said Altman was asked to join a video meeting at noon Friday with the company\u2019s board members, minus Brockman, during which OpenAI co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever informed Altman he was being fired.\n\n\u201cSam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did today,\u201d Brockman wrote, adding that he was informed of his removal from the board in a separate call with Sutskever a short time later.\n\nOpenAI declined to answer questions on what Altman\u2019s alleged lack of candor was about. The statement said his behavior was hindering the board\u2019s ability to exercise its responsibilities.\n\nAltman posted Friday on X: \u201ci loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people. will have more to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement allowing OpenAI access to part of the AP\u2019s text archives.\n\nAltman helped start OpenAI as a nonprofit research laboratory in 2015. But it was ChatGPT\u2019s explosion into public consciousness that thrust Altman into the spotlight as a face of generative AI \u2014 technology that can produce novel imagery, passages of text and other media. On a world tour this year, he was mobbed by a crowd of adoring fans at an event in London.\n\nHe\u2019s sat with multiple heads of state to discuss AI\u2019s potential and perils. Just Thursday, he took part in a CEO summit at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in San Francisco, where OpenAI is based.\n\nHe predicted AI will prove to be \u201cthe greatest leap forward of any of the big technological revolutions we\u2019ve had so far.\u201d He also acknowledged the need for guardrails, calling attention to the existential dangers future AI could pose.\n\nSome computer scientists have criticized that focus on far-off risks as distracting from the real-world limitations and harms of current AI products. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has launched an investigation into whether OpenAI violated consumer protection laws by scraping public data and publishing false information through its chatbot.\n\nThe company said its board consists of OpenAI\u2019s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, and three non-employees: Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo, tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Helen Toner of the Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s key business partner, Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars into the startup and helped provide the computing power to run its AI systems, said that the transition won\u2019t affect its relationship.\n\n\u201cWe have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers,\u201d said an emailed Microsoft statement.\n\nWhile not trained as an AI engineer, Altman, now 38, has been seen as a Silicon Valley wunderkind since his early 20s. He was recruited in 2014 to take lead of the startup incubator YCombinator.\n\n\u201cSam is one of the smartest people I know, and understands startups better than perhaps anyone I know, including myself,\u201d read YCombinator co-founder Paul Graham\u2019s 2014 announcement that Altman would become its president. Graham said at the time that Altman was \u201cone of those rare people who manage to be both fearsomely effective and yet fundamentally benevolent.\u201d\n\nOpenAI started out as a nonprofit when it launched with financial backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others. Its stated aims were to \u201cadvance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.\u201d\n\nThat changed in 2018 when it incorporated a for-profit business Open AI LP, and shifted nearly all its staff into the business, not long after releasing its first generation of the GPT large language model for mimicking human writing. Around the same time, Musk, who had co-chaired its board with Altman, resigned from the board in a move that OpenAI said would eliminate a \u201cpotential future conflict for Elon\u201d due to Tesla\u2019s work on building self-driving systems.\n\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s board has preserved its nonprofit governance structure, the startup it oversees has increasingly sought to capitalize on its technology by tailoring its popular chatbot to business customers.\n\nAt its first developer conference last week, Altman was the main speaker showcasing a vision for a future of AI agents that could help people with a variety of tasks. Days later, he announced the company would have to pause new subscriptions to its premium version of ChatGPT because it had exceeded capacity.\n\nAltman\u2019s exit \u201cis indeed shocking as he has been the face of\u201d generative AI technology, said Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran.\n\nHe said OpenAI still has a \u201cdeep bench of technical leaders\u201d but its next executives will have to steer it through the challenges of scaling the business and meeting the expectations of regulators and society.\n\nForrester analyst Rowan Curran speculated that Altman\u2019s departure, \u201cwhile sudden,\u201d did not likely reflect deeper business problems.\n\n\u201cThis seems to be a case of an executive transition that was about issues with the individual in question, and not with the underlying technology or business,\u201d Curran said.\n\nAltman has a number of possible next steps. Even while running OpenAI, he placed large bets on several other ambitious projects.\n\nAmong them are Helion Energy, for developing fusion reactors that could produce prodigious amounts of energy from the hydrogen in seawater, and Retro Biosciences, which aims to add 10 years to the human lifespan using biotechnology. Altman also co-founded Worldcoin, a biometric and cryptocurrency project that\u2019s been scanning people\u2019s eyeballs with the goal of creating a vast digital identity and financial network.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press business writers Haleluya Hadero in New York, Kelvin Chan in London and Michael Liedtke and David Hamilton in San Francisco contributed to this report."}, {"title": "WTF is going on at OpenAI? We have theories", "author": "Devin Coldewey", "source": "TechCrunch", "published_at": "2023-11-18T00:09:53+00:00", "category": "technology", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/wtf-is-going-on-at-openai-sam-altman-fired/", "body": "In perhaps the most unexpected tech news of the year, billionaire and AI evangelist Sam Altman has been ejected from his CEO role at OpenAI by the company\u2019s board after an apparent vote of no confidence. Its exact wording in a release issued this afternoon: Altman\u2019s \u201cdeparture follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.\u201d\n\nWhat the hell is happening at the most hyped company in the world?! Here are some totally speculative theories that occurred to us and others around the web.\n\n1. Did Altman circumvent the board in a major deal?\n\nBased on the board\u2019s language and the way these giant tech companies work, this is the prevailing theory floating around right now. \u201cNot consistently candid\u201d is a very diplomatic way of saying Altman lied.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Altman \u2014 and potentially OpenAI President Greg Brockman, who stepped down as chairman simultaneously, then resigned \u2014 wanted to make a bold move that he knew the board would not like. It\u2019s not uncommon for these deals to be hammered out quietly in smoke- (or vape-) filled rooms and then presented as a fait accompli, but if it was controversial enough and the board found out about these maneuvers, it could be fuel for an ouster.\n\nBut what kind of deal would be big and dangerous enough for a summary dismissal of the CEO and famous face of the company? The man was onstage two weeks ago; I just talked with him! What could have happened since then?\n\nFew would be shocked if Microsoft, which is deeply, deeply embedded in OpenAI as an investor and customer, is a factor here. Could Altman have been working with \u2014 or against \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s patron in secret? If Altman wanted to kill the golden goose by going independent, that might have activated the board\u2019s fiduciary or otherwise statutory duty. On the other hand, if he was negotiating some other deal, like an acquisition or deeper and more exclusive integration, it could also have caused the board to bristle, either at the idea itself or at being excluded.\n\nBut if Microsoft was as shocked as the rest of us, as one report has it, it could hardly be the kind of high-stakes conspiracy some seem to be hoping for. But one must assume that Microsoft would say that either way. Even if they\u2019d been working with Altman on some kind of secret plan, they can truthfully say they were surprised by his firing. (And they \u201cremain committed to our partnership.\u201d)\n\n2. Do they disagree on long-term strategy?\n\nDespite being the hottest tech company in the world right now and everyone talking about ChatGPT, OpenAI isn\u2019t exactly a sound business. It\u2019s shoveling money into the furnace as fast as it can by serving, by all accounts, a fantastically expensive product at bargain-bin prices.\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good for a year or two, but at some point that strategy changes from a growth hack to an existential liability. Could Altman and the board have had irreconcilable differences on where that point lies?\n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem so likely. The company has been very deliberately pursuing this very publicly, confidently and on a long-term basis. Altman and the board seem to be in sync on this, at least for the present.\n\n3. Do the numbers not add up?\n\nOn the other hand, could OpenAI be losing even more money than Altman admitted or projected? It seems impossible, but the costs of running this operation have no precedent, nor really does the operation itself.\n\nOr what if, and again this is purely speculation, Altman has been secretly pursuing an internal project, perhaps at significant cost, against the advice of the board and without the necessary safety measures that probably should accompany such research? It sounds a little wild, but firing your CEO like this is also a little wild.\n\nSome kind of major mismatch in the financial department could be cause for dismissal, but it\u2019s hard to imagine what Altman could have kept from the board and CTO that would be so damning.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that Altman was making personal investments in a way that the board disagreed with. With OpenAI poised to be a kingmaker in the field, he would certainly be in a position of power. One would think that, as an ideologically driven person already rich beyond belief and at the head of the world\u2019s leading AI company, Altman would have risen beyond having to do this kind of side deal, or at the very least that scrutiny on him and those close to him would prevent them. But one can never be sure.\n\n4. Could it be a major security or privacy incident?\n\nThe idea that the company has experienced a major, perhaps pervasive, security issue is bolstered by the fact that Microsoft reportedly suspended use of ChatGPT internally a few days ago. OpenAI subsequently stopped allowing new signups. If there was a serious security problem in its biggest product and Altman downplayed it, that would obviously create distrust with the board.\n\nThere is also the potential for misuse at scale with the enormous amount of personal data that travels through OpenAI\u2019s APIs and services.\n\nWorking against this theory is the fact that CTO Mira Murati was just elevated to interim CEO in Altman\u2019s place. It seems unlikely that anything security-related would go through the CEO and not the CTO, or that the two would be at odds to the point where one could be fired like this and the other swapped in to clean up the mess. As the board\u2019s statement notes, Murati is in charge of product and safety, among other things. Any significant snafu in that department would reflect on her, as well as Altman.\n\n5. Perhaps a difference of AI ethics or philosophy?\n\nAltman is a proud techno-optimist, and often speaks fondly of the possibilities of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a theoretical software system that achieves human-like intellect and versatility.\n\nThe board\u2019s statement pointedly includes that \u201cOpenAI was deliberately structured to advance our mission: to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all humanity\u201d and that new leadership was necessary. It\u2019s possible that Sam\u2019s zeal for AGI, even absent a secret project or agreement, led to a major rift between him and the board.\n\nIt\u2019s been obvious to all that Altman took the company in a much more corporate direction from its origins, changing its legal status and aggressively pursuing enterprise and consumer applications. That doesn\u2019t sound a lot like the \u201cmission\u201d the board wants to advance. Then again, this shift didn\u2019t happen today, and it certainly doesn\u2019t seem like a plausible reason for abruptly firing the CEO and a few others on a beautiful fall Friday afternoon.\n\n6. What about IP and legal liability?\n\nAltman told me at OpenAI\u2019s Dev Day earlier this month that the company doesn\u2019t want to incur any copyright problems by using (as I had asked about) datasets of pirated books. But a lot of research I\u2019ve been reading contradicts that, as does pretty much every AI data scientist I talk to. It\u2019s exceedingly hard to imagine that OpenAI built GPT-3 with the copyrighted books database (as seems to be the case) but not GPT-4 or succeeding models. (I was going to write this up next week, so thanks OpenAI board for eating my lunch.)\n\nIf you were the board and facing the mounting accusations that your product was built on a dataset that includes thousands or millions of copyrighted works \u2014 and your CEO had systematically downplayed the potential liability there \u2014 how would you feel? I\u2019d feel very hurt.\n\nBut again, if copyright liability was the reason, it seems unlikely that the board would promote the CTO. Presumably, OpenAI\u2019s Chief Science Officer Ilya Sutskever would also have been in the know, and he\u2019s still on the board.\n\n7. Did CTO Mira Murati launch a coup?\n\nProbably not \u2014 she seems cool, and anyway what CTO wants to be CEO? Mira, answer my email!\n\n8. Was it a \u201cpersonal matter\u201d?\n\nWhen someone is kicked out in a hurry, it\u2019s not uncommon that there was some kind of unprofessional behavior in the workplace. Some CEOs get a pass on things like having kids with direct reports, but not all.\n\nAltman also has three siblings, and his younger sister Annie has publicly accused him of abuse. We have no way of evaluating these allegations, which involve private matters.\n\nOur read on the board\u2019s language in dismissing Altman, however, is that it was not a legal or personal problem that provoked the action, but a professional or business one.\n\nWe probably won\u2019t know the full truth on this for a long time, as the characters in the drama are likely to be NDA\u2019ed up. Per various whispers and leaks, an all-hands meeting about the situation this afternoon didn\u2019t produce any revelations beyond banal reassurances that the company is fine and they\u2019ll get a fresh CEO soon. Expect to hear a lot of rumors before we hear the real thing."}, {"title": "Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president", "author": "Michael R.

Trump has long insisted he did nothing wrong.\n\nThe decision, days before the start of a non-jury trial in Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 lawsuit, is the strongest repudiation yet of Trump\u2019s carefully coiffed image as a wealthy and shrewd real estate mogul turned political powerhouse.\n\nBeyond mere bragging about his riches, Trump, his company and key executives repeatedly lied about them on his annual financial statements, reaping rewards such as favorable loan terms and lower insurance premiums, Engoron found.\n\nThose tactics crossed a line and violated the law, the judge said, rejecting Trump\u2019s contention that a disclaimer on the financial statements absolved him of any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cIn defendants\u2019 world: rent regulated apartments are worth the same as unregulated apartments; restricted land is worth the same as unrestricted land; restrictions can evaporate into thin air; a disclaimer by one party casting responsibility on another party exonerates the other party\u2019s lies,\u201d Engoron wrote in his 35-page ruling. \u201cThat is a fantasy world, not the real world.\u201d\n\nManhattan prosecutors had looked into bringing a criminal case over the same conduct but declined to do so, leaving James to sue Trump and seek penalties that could disrupt his and his family\u2019s ability to do business in the state.\n\nEngoron\u2019s ruling, in a phase of the case known as summary judgment, resolves the key claim in James\u2019 lawsuit, but six others remain.\n\nEngoron is slated to hold a non-jury trial starting Oct. 2 before deciding on those claims and any punishments he may impose. James is seeking $250 million in penalties and a ban on Trump doing business in New York, his home state. The trial could last into December, Engoron has said.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers had asked the judge to throw out the case, which he denied. They contend that James wasn\u2019t legally allowed to file the lawsuit because there isn\u2019t any evidence that the public was harmed by Trump\u2019s actions. They also argued that many of the allegations in the lawsuit were barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nEngoron, noting that he had \u201cemphatically rejected\u201d those arguments earlier in the case, equated them to the \u201ctime-loop in the film \u2018Groundhog Day.'\u201d\n\nJames, a Democrat, sued Trump and the Trump Organization a year ago, alleging a pattern of duplicity that she dubbed \u201cthe art of the steal,\u201d a twist on the title of Trump\u2019s 1987 business memoir \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit accused Trump and his company of routinely inflating the value of assets like skyscrapers, golf courses and his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, padding his bottom line by billions.\n\nAmong the allegations were that Trump claimed his Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan \u2014 a three-story penthouse replete with gold-plated fixtures \u2014 was nearly three times its actual size and valued the property at $327 million. No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount, James said.\n\nTrump valued Mar-a-Lago as high as $739 million \u2014 more than 10 times a more reasonable estimate of its worth. Trump\u2019s figure for the private club and residence was based on the idea that the property could be developed for residential use, but deed terms prohibit that, James said.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing, arguing in sworn testimony for the case that it didn\u2019t matter what he put on his financial statements because they have a disclaimer that says they shouldn\u2019t be trusted. He told James at the April deposition, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a case and you should drop this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know the banks were fully paid? Do you know the banks made a lot of money?\u201d Trump testified. \u201cDo you know I don\u2019t believe I ever got even a default notice, and even during COVID, the banks were all paid? And yet you\u2019re suing on behalf of banks, I guess. It\u2019s crazy. The whole case is crazy.\u201d\n\nEngoron rejected that argument when the defense previously sought to have the case thrown out.\n\nThe judge said the disclaimer on the financial statements \u201cmakes abundantly clear that Mr. Trump was fully responsible for the information contained within\u201d them and that \u201callowing blanket disclaimers to insulate liars from liability would completely undercut\u201d the \u201cimportant function\u201d that such statements serve \u201cin the real world.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 lawsuit is one of several legal headaches for Trump as he campaigns for a return to the White House in 2024. He has been indicted four times in the last six months \u2014 accused in Georgia and Washington, D.C., of plotting to overturn his 2020 election loss, in Florida of hoarding classified documents, and in Manhattan of falsifying business records related to hush money paid on his behalf.\n\nThe Trump Organization was convicted of tax fraud last year in an unrelated criminal case for helping executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. The company was fined $1.6 million. One of the executives, Trump\u2019s longtime finance chief Allen Weisselberg, pleaded guilty and served five months in jail. He is a defendant in James\u2019 lawsuit and gave sworn deposition testimony for the case in May.\n\nJames\u2019 lawsuit does not carry the potential of prison time, but could complicate his ability to transact real estate deals. It could also stain his legacy as a developer.\n\nJames has asked Engoron to ban Trump and his three eldest children from ever again running a company based New York. She also wants Trump and the Trump Organization barred from entering into commercial real estate acquisitions for five years, among other sanctions. The $250 million in penalties she is seeking is the estimated worth of benefits derived from the alleged fraud, she said.\n\nJames, who campaigned for office as a Trump critic and watchdog, started scrutinizing his business practices in March 2019 after his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress that Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements provided to Deutsche Bank while trying to obtain financing to buy the NFL\u2019s Buffalo Bills.\n\nJames\u2019 office previously sued Trump for misusing his own charitable foundation to further his political and business interests. Trump was ordered to pay $2 million to an array of charities as a fine and the charity, the Trump Foundation, was shut down."}, {"title": "The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer", "author": "Tom Maloney", "source": "The Age", "published_at": "2023-11-07T22:22:05+00:00", "category": "business", "url": "https://www.theage.com.au/business/companies/the-777-million-surprise-donald-trump-is-getting-richer-20231108-p5eicf.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_business", "body": "Thousands of pages of exhibits detailing the performance of his assets made available during the trial have provided a deeper look into his fortune. The former president\u2019s 2021 statement of financial condition, filed as part of the lawsuit, pegged his net worth at $US4.5 billion. Bloomberg\u2019s calculation has consistently been below Trump\u2019s figures. At the same time, Bloomberg measured the value of some Trump properties higher than what New York state claims. Trump took the stand and testified that the properties whose values he\u2019s accused of inflating were actually undervalued, based on the premium his \u201cbrand\u201d adds. He also said that banks didn\u2019t rely on his statements of financial condition when weighing loans. \u201cThey just weren\u2019t a very important element in banks\u2019 decision-making process,\u201d Trump told the court. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll explain that as this trial goes along.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at New York state\u2019s valuation of four high-profile Trump properties where the prosecution alleges fraud occurred, along with Bloomberg\u2019s own approach to assessing the assets.\n\nMar-a-Lago Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US612.1 million , Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US240 million, New York\u2019s valuation (2021): $US27.6 million It\u2019s fair to say that Trump\u2019s most famous property these days is no longer New York\u2019s Trump Tower but his Mar-a-Lago Club, the historic Palm Beach estate built by Marjorie Merriweather Post in the 1920s that he now calls home. New York\u2019s valuation of Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate has raised eyebrows. Credit: AP The sprawling resort has been at the centre of some publicised post-presidency scandals, from classified documents being kept in one of its bathrooms to the location where Trump is said to have shared nuclear submarine secrets with Australian businessman Anthony Pratt \u2014 something that Trump denies.\n\nIt\u2019s also a major focus in Trump\u2019s fraud lawsuit. Trump made a series of agreements with Palm Beach County and the National Trust for Historic Preservation for Mar-a-Lago to be used only as a club, giving up any development rights. Consequently, Palm Beach values the property as a business on its tax rolls. In 2021, the county assessed it at $US27.6 million, lower than comparable residential properties. New York State argues that this appraisal is the one Trump should have been using. New York\u2019s estimated value \u201cwas a shock to the real estate community and anybody with any understanding of the island and its values,\u201d said Liza Pulitzer, a real estate agent at Brown Harris Stevens and a Palm Beach native. \u201cIt could easily fetch $US500 million or more.\u201d\n\nThat assumes a buyer views it as a single-family residence. It\u2019s currently not zoned for such use, though Trump is able to reside there through a loophole designating himself an employee. Trump\u2019s legal team engaged an expert witness who argued that a future buyer could do the same thing. And if they didn\u2019t like the idea of sharing their property with others, they could reduce the club to a membership of one. Still, it\u2019s unclear if Palm Beach would allow that without a change to its zoning status. Historically, Mar-a-Lago never made much money for the Trump Organisation, but that seems to be changing. It took in about $US41 million in revenue last year, according to Trump\u2019s most recent ethics disclosure, compared with $US21 million in 2019. Bloomberg values Mar-a-Lago at $US240 million, based on a combination of comparable residential property sales in the area as well as its value as a business, reflecting some uncertainty around its future status. That uncertainty isn\u2019t shared by everyone. If the city and county allowed it, \u201cthere is no reason why it wouldn\u2019t be able to converted to a full-time private residence,\u201d said Eli Beracha, director of the Hollo School of Real Estate at Florida International University.\n\nTrump\u2019s Fifth Avenue penthouse Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US131.3 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US40 million, New York valuation: No current estimate available Trump\u2019s penthouse apartment at Trump Tower has been an integral part of his image for 40 years, so it\u2019s not surprising that one of the world\u2019s masters of hyperbole exaggerated its size for most of that time. Trump\u2019s penthouse apartment at Trump Tower has been an integral part of his image for 40 years. Credit: AP Between 2011 and 2016, Trump valued his apartment based on it being 30,000 square feet (2,787 square metres) in size \u2014 almost triple its actual measurement of 10,996 square feet. Because of this, New York State arrived at a valuation that was about a third of Trump\u2019s in those years. They haven\u2019t provided a more recent estimate.\n\nSpace inflation wasn\u2019t the only issue. Between 2014 and 2015, Trump increased the value of the apartment to $US327 million from $US200 million. The prosecution argues that was to mask a drop in the value of one of his other properties. \u201cA discrepancy of this order of magnitude, by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades, can only be considered fraud,\u201d Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a September ruling. \u2018The company has never been stronger and never been better.\u2019 Eric Trump Bloomberg values the property using recent Trump Tower sales, as well as those of comparable Manhattan penthouses. While some splashy residences in much newer buildings on so-called Billionaires Row have listed for well in excess of $US100 million, they typically boast higher ceilings, more up-to-date finishes, contemporary layouts, outdoor space and better views. A better comparison would be a 9450-square-foot penthouse in Olympic Tower, five blocks south on Fifth Avenue, which has been on and off the market for $US35 million since 2016. Then there\u2019s Carl Icahn\u2019s 14,000-square-foot penthouse at Museum Tower on West 53rd Street. It was listed for $US35 million in 2019 before he attempted to split the space and sell it as two separate apartments. Both were eventually delisted.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Trump would get a higher price because of his name. \u201cThere would be a Trump premium because the person that would want that property is likely to be a Trump supporter,\u201d Beracha said. But it\u2019s also likely that the association with Trump would turn off some buyers. Trump Park Avenue Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US90.9 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US86.4 million, New York\u2019s valuation (2021): $US80 million The residential condo tower on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, formerly the Hotel Delmonico, isn\u2019t one of Trump\u2019s best-known buildings, but it\u2019s been the source of some significant asset inflations, according to the prosecution.\n\nIts value to Trump mostly stems from unsold condo units that are owned by the Trump Organisation and rented out. A varying number have been rent-stabilised, meaning tenants pay below market rates. Typically, these apartments are valued at a discount because tenants can stay indefinitely, sometimes even passing them on to children. In 2010, 12 rent-stabilised apartments owned by Trump were valued at an average of $US62,500 each in an appraisal provided by a real estate company. The following year, Trump valued them at $US4.1 million each \u2014 more than 65 times greater. Trump has continued to value stabilised apartments in the building at market rates, including in his 2021 statement of financial condition. Rent-stabilised units \u201cwith a positive cash flow are often valued at 15-25 cents a dollar of the open market value, versus single digits for negative cash flow,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, president of appraiser Miller Samuel. Still, Trump\u2019s optimism was shown to be at least partially justified. By 2021, only five of the 12 apartments remained rent stabilised. The prosecution also claims two additional non-stabilised apartments in the building were overvalued because Trump ignored an option his daughter, Ivanka Trump, had to buy them at a price lower than the market value he used.\n\n40 Wall Street Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US664 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US270 million, New York\u2019s valuation: No current estimate available In valuing his flagship lower Manhattan office tower, Trump consistently ignored more conservative appraisals he\u2019d received from professionals, New York State argues. Trump has been accused of significantly over-valuing his flagship downtown New York property. Credit: Bloomberg For example, 40 Wall Street was appraised by a real estate company at $US200 million in 2011 and $US220 million in 2012. Despite this, Trump valued the property in financial statements at $US524.7 million and $US527.2 million, respectively, for those years.\n\nBloomberg uses a capitalisation of net income approach in coming up with an estimate. Valuations for commercial offices across the board have taken a hit in the past 18 months amid rising interest rates and a lacklustre corporate leasing market. But 40 Wall Street has its own unique problems. Tenant departures meant occupancy slid to 77 per cent in June, down from 98 per cent in 2015. Its net operating income is only 61 per cent of what was projected by underwriters. Loading \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of leasing velocity down there,\u201d said Albert Sultan, a broker at Kassin Sabbagh Realty. The financial district used to offer a lower cost for tenants, but with Midtown rents declining, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to go downtown.\u201d The property is also subject to a ground lease that resets in 2032 at either 6 per cent of the land value or 85 per cent of its rent in the prior year. Based on current rent, that means the ground lease would jump to $US30 million from about $US2.6 million now."}, {"title": "Chelsea and England star Cole Palmer: \u2018The most annoying thing about moving down south?

It has been a few months of swift change. He is trying to get used to new surroundings, having swapped south Manchester \u2013 in his native Wythenshawe \u2013 for the South.\n\n\u201cThe most annoying thing? The traffic, that\u2019s the biggest thing for me. Everything else I am enjoying. It is hotter than Manchester as well,\u201d he said. Certainly Palmer feels hot property right now, albeit while exhibiting a certain coolness. He was calm enough to score an injury-time penalty for his new club against his old on Sunday, completing a 4-4 draw, and cheeky enough to poke his head into a City huddle when they were lining up a free-kick, to the amusement of Erling Haaland.\n\nPerhaps it summed up Palmer\u2019s inability to feel intimidated by anything that he marked his goal against City with a shrug. There was no getting carried away. \u201cI spent 15 years at the club,\u201d he noted. \u201cI can\u2019t really go and celebrate how I would celebrate if I have scored a 95th-minute equaliser because it would have been disrespectful.\u201d\n\nThe alternative explanation is that Palmer has scored so many major goals in the last few months that this was merely another. He struck in the Community Shield and the European Super Cup for City, against Arsenal and Tottenham for Chelsea. That big-match temperament may equip him for tournament football in an England shirt. So, too, his nerveless penalty-taking.\n\nPalmer in training at St George\u2019s Park this week (PA)\n\nHe has, in effect, anointed himself as the spot-kick taker for the \u00a31bn team, taking the ball at Turf Moor to open his Chelsea account. \u201cIt was just an in-game thing, really,\u201d he said, with a matter-of-fact stance. \u201cOnce I scored at Burnley, I just thought: \u2018I\u2019ll take them\u2019.\u201d If penalties have been the English disease, Palmer has no hesitation when asked if he would be willing to come off the bench as a specialist from 12 yards for a shootout. \u201cYeah, I would be,\u201d he said.\n\nHe is not daunted by the last penalty he missed, as a substitute in the shootout when City lost the 2019 FA Youth Cup final to Liverpool. He can only remember failing from 12 yards on one other occasion, \u201cwhen I was dead, dead young versus [Manchester] United,\u201d and a willingness to take responsibility is similarly apparent in open play. \u201cI think I am a player who always wants the ball, anywhere, to try and help the team get out of a difficult situation or create a chance,\u201d he said.\n\nIf he has created an opportunity for himself with his country because of his excellence at Stamford Bridge, it had not formed part of his thinking. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking of an England call-up when I first went to Chelsea,\u201d he said.\n\nNor, indeed, was it on his agenda as a boy, when his mother banned him from playing in the garden. \u201cI was always breaking her pipes,\u201d he recalled. He has come a long way since then; particularly in 2023. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s been crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe changes have happened so fast. From winning the Euros to signing for Chelsea then getting signed up here.\u201d\n\nPalmer chats with Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka (The FA/Getty)\n\nHis part in England Under-21s\u2019 European Championship win may have caught Gareth Southgate\u2019s eye. His immediate decision was whether he had done enough to impress Pep Guardiola. There had been interest in taking him on loan, from Brighton and Burnley and RB Leipzig. City decided that he could only leave on a permanent deal and Chelsea forked out \u00a342.5m. \u201cWho knows what would have happened if I had stayed?\u201d Palmer mused. \u201cMaybe I would have played more, maybe not. But I think the decision to go to Chelsea so far is paying off.\u201d\n\nThat is an understatement. And if there seemed a risk involved in swapping the stability of City for the seeming madhouse of Stamford Bridge, there was evidence of more cool-headed thinking from a 21-year-old. Chelsea have been manic buyers but he said: \u201cI did look at how many players were there but I don\u2019t think people realise how many players they actually got rid off, as well.\u201d\n\nThe departures of, among others, Mason Mount, Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic and Joao Felix, meant there could be opportunities in the attacking midfield positions. \u201cI looked at the squad and thought: \u2018If I go there and know what I can do then I\u2019ll have the chance of playing\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd thankfully it\u2019s happened.\u201d If there seemed plenty of traffic in the queue for places in Southgate\u2019s attack, Palmer seems to have accelerated past several rivals. Now an England debut could follow in the next week."}, {"title": "The people who ruined the internet", "author": "Amanda Chicago Lewis", "source": "The Verge", "published_at": "2023-11-01T13:00:00+00:00", "category": "technology", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results", "body": "The alligator got my attention. Which, of course, was the point. When you hear that a 10-foot alligator is going to be released at a rooftop bar in South Florida, at a party for the people being accused of ruining the internet, you can\u2019t quite stop yourself from being curious. If it was a link \u2014 \u201cWATCH: 10-foot Gator Prepares to Maul Digital Marketers\u201d \u2014 I would have clicked. But it was an IRL opportunity to meet the professionals who specialize in this kind of gimmick, the people turning online life into what one tech writer recently called a \u201csearch-optimized hellhole.\u201d So I booked a plane ticket to the Sunshine State.\n\nI wanted to understand: what kind of human spends their days exploiting our dumbest impulses for traffic and profit? Who the hell are these people making money off of everyone else\u2019s misery?\n\nAfter all, a lot of folks are unhappy, in 2023, with their ability to find information on the internet, which, for almost everyone, means the quality of Google Search results. The links that pop up when they go looking for answers online, they say, are \u201cabsolutely unusable\u201d; \u201cgarbage\u201d; and \u201ca nightmare\u201d because \u201ca lot of the content doesn\u2019t feel authentic.\u201d Some blame Google itself, asserting that an all-powerful, all-seeing, trillion-dollar corporation with a 90 percent market share for online search is corrupting our access to the truth. But others blame the people I wanted to see in Florida, the ones who engage in the mysterious art of search engine optimization, or SEO.\n\nDoing SEO is less straightforward than buying the advertising space labeled \u201cSponsored\u201d above organic search results; it\u2019s more like the Wizard of Oz projecting his voice to magnify his authority. The goal is to tell the algorithm whatever it needs to hear for a site to appear as high up as possible in search results, leveraging Google\u2019s supposed objectivity to lure people in and then, usually, show them some kind of advertising. Voil\u00e0: a business model! Over time, SEO techniques have spread and become insidious, such that googling anything can now feel like looking up \u201csneaker\u201d in the dictionary and finding a definition that sounds both incorrect and suspiciously as though it were written by someone promoting Nike (\u201cfootwear that allows you to just do it!\u201d). Perhaps this is why nearly everyone hates SEO and the people who do it for a living: the practice seems to have successfully destroyed the illusion that the internet was ever about anything other than selling stuff.\n\nSo who ends up with a career in SEO? The stereotype is that of a hustler: a content goblin willing to eschew rules, morals, and good taste in exchange for eyeballs and mountains of cash. A nihilist in it for the thrills, a prankster gleeful about getting away with something.\n\n\u201cThis is modern-day pirate shit, as close as you can get,\u201d explained Cade Lee, who prepared me over the phone for what to expect in Florida based on over a decade working in SEO. What Lee said he\u2019s noticed most at SEO conferences and SEO networking events is a certain arrogance. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely an ego among all of them,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou succeed, and now you\u2019re a genius. Now you\u2019ve outdone Google.\u201d\n\nThe more I thought about search engine optimization and how a bunch of megalomaniacal jerks were degrading our collective sense of reality because they wanted to buy Lamborghinis and prove they could vanquish the almighty algorithm \u2014 which, technically, constitutes many algorithms, but we think of as a single force \u2014 the more I looked forward to going to Florida for this alligator party. Maybe, I thought, I would get to see someone who made millions clogging the internet with bullshit get the ultimate comeuppance. Maybe an SEO professional would get attacked by a gigantic, prehistoric-looking reptile right there in front of me. Maybe I could even repackage such a tragedy into a sensationalized anecdote for a viral article about the people who do SEO for a living, strongly implying that nature was here to punish the bad guy while somehow also assuming the ethical high ground and pretending I hadn\u2019t been hoping this exact thing would happen from the start.\n\nBecause I, too, use Google. I, too, want reliable and relevant things to come up when I look through this vast compendium of human knowledge. And I, too, enjoy the sweet taste of revenge.\n\nThe first thing that went wrong at the alligator party was the alligator was only five and a half feet long, not 10 feet, as advertised. Classic clickbait!\n\nThe second thing that went wrong at the alligator party was that I found almost everyone I met to be sympathetic, or at least nice enough not to want to see them get maimed by a five-and-a-half-foot alligator. My harshest assessment of the 200 digital marketers taking shots and swaying to a dancehall reggae band was that they dressed like they lived in Florida, which almost all of them did.\n\nTake Missy Ward, a blonde in an orange bandage dress so tight she told me she couldn\u2019t take full steps. She laughed as she explained that she\u2019d ordered the dress on Amazon and hadn\u2019t tried it on until the day of the alligator party. Ward had a feisty, wry energy that made me want to root for her. When she started doing SEO in 1998, she said, it was \u201cfive girls and all dudes.\u201d She eventually sold her company for $40 million. Somehow, in the moment, I was psyched to hear this. She was being so patient, explaining the history of SEO and suggesting other people for me to reach out to. I should really go talk with that guy across the room, who had a long-running podcast about SEO, she said, the one in the sky blue polo.\n\nHis name was Daron Babin, and I quickly learned he was just the kind of \u201cmodern-day pirate shit\u201d guy I\u2019d been warned about: thrilled at the opportunity to recount the brilliant trickery that had allowed him to line his pockets. His SEO career got going in 1994, before Google even existed. \u201cThe air of manipulation was insane,\u201d Babin told me. \u201cWe had this weird community of geeks and nerds, and we all talked to each other about how we were beating the algorithms up,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were trying to outrank other people just for bragging rights.\u201d\n\nWe were chatting on a patio overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, between the buffet and the band, when the host of the alligator party, Darren Blatt, came up to say how glad he was that I\u2019d found Daron Babin.\n\n\u201cIt was like I won the lottery, and I didn\u2019t know how long it would last.\u201d\n\nDarren and Daron (pronounced the same way) have been friends for decades, since the era when Darren \u201cD-Money\u201d Blatt would throw rap star-studded internet marketing shindigs during the Adult Video News Awards in Vegas, back when sex sites were among the most advanced in technology, and Daron Babin was using SEO to promote offshore casinos and Viagra (\u201cWe were outranking Pfizer!\u201d). Together, Darren and Daron managed to milk all three of the early online cash cows: porn, pills, and gambling.\n\nAs the internet became more regulated and mainstream, around the turn of the century, Darren noticed Daron\u2019s SEO skills were increasingly in demand. \u201cI told him that he was missing the boat, that he needed to be a consultant and charge a few grand,\u201d Darren said.\n\nDaron took the advice, asking for $2,000 a day, and watched his career explode. \u201cI would wake up in a city and not know what time zone I was in,\u201d he recalled. To slow the pace, he upped it to $5,000 a day, but \u201cit seemed the more I raised my rates, the more gigs I was getting.\u201d\n\nNowadays, he mostly invests in cannabis and psychedelics. SEO just got to be too complicated for not enough money, he told me. Ward had told me the same thing, that she had stopped focusing on SEO years ago.\n\nI was considering how it was possible that so many people have been complaining recently about SEO ruining the internet if these people were telling me the SEO business is in decline when I met Jairo Bastilla. He was the kind of tall, charming man who described himself multiple times as \u201ca nerd,\u201d and he pointed out that even though working directly with search engine rankings is \u201cno longer monetizing at the highest payout,\u201d the same \u201ccore knowledge of SEO\u201d remains relevant for everything from native advertising to social media.\n\nTranslation? SEO is now baked into everything. Bastilla, for example, specializes in email campaigns, which he called \u201cdeliverability.\u201d\n\nAs a person who militantly unsubscribes to any and all marketing emails, I suddenly felt claustrophobic, surrounded by people who annoy the rest of us for a living. Why does it always seem to surprise me, even after all these years, that the way we behave on the internet is often quite different from how we act in real life?\n\nI wandered off to wait in line for a drink, where I noticed several people nonchalantly making space in a corner, as if to move out of the way for a bartender carrying empty glasses. There, squirming along the ground, was the alligator himself, wagging his tail, snout held shut by a thin strip of electrical tape. His handler was nowhere in sight. It was an unsettling vision, a predator pretending to be just another party guest.\n\n\u201cThey should untape the mouth!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cI\u2019m not even scared.\u201d\n\nAs sunset turned to dusk, I found Daron Babin again, and he started telling me about one of his signature moves, back in the \u201990s, involving fake domain names: \u201cI could make it look like it was somebody else, but it actually redirected to me!\u201d What he and his competitors did was legal but well beyond what the dominant search engine allowed. He never faced any consequences, but in the end, internet users at large felt the effects: \u201cIt muddied up Yahoo, ultimately,\u201d he said, \u201cbut while it worked, we banked.\u201d\n\nThe situation sounded familiar. But I liked Babin. He was funny and smart, a keen observer of the SEO world. \u201cWe\u2019re entering a very weird time, technologically, with AI, from an optimization standpoint,\u201d he told me. Anyone who thought the internet was already saturated with SEO-oriented content should buckle up.\n\n\u201cAll the assholes that are out there paying shitty link-building companies to build shitty articles,\u201d he said, \u201cnow they can go and use the free version of GPT.\u201d Soon, he said, Google results would be even worse, dominated entirely by AI-generated crap designed to please the algorithms, produced and published at volumes far beyond anything humans could create, far beyond anything we\u2019d ever seen before.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not gonna be able to stop the onslaught of it,\u201d he said. Then he laughed and laughed, thinking about how puny and irrelevant Google seemed in comparison to the next generation of automated SEO. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop it!\u201d\n\nOnce I was safe at home, my alligator attack bluster having deflated into an irrepressible affection for clever scoundrels, mixed with fear about the future promised by said scoundrels, I decided to seek a broader range of the people who do SEO for a living. Perhaps the ones who live in Florida were simply too, well, Florida, and the ones who live elsewhere might be more principled? An old contact heard I was writing about SEO and suggested I find a man he called Legendary Lars: \u201cHe was an absolute god in that space.\u201d\n\nI tracked down Lars Mapstead in Northern California, where he was preparing to run for president in 2024 as a Libertarian. Mapstead spent the first two years of his life in a Volkswagen van traveling the Pacific coast before his hippie parents settled on a Big Sur property with goats, chickens, and no electricity. He became a tinkerer and an autodidact, the guy who reads the instruction manual and fixes everything himself. When he first heard about the World Wide Web, it was 1993, and he was working for a company selling computer motherboards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the freedom of information!\u201d he remembered thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s all just about collaborating and bettering mankind!\u201d\n\nHe learned how to build a website and then how to submit a site to be listed in early search directories like AltaVista, WebCrawler, Infoseek, and Lycos. He learned how to create chat rooms, attracting people spread across the globe, all alone in their homes but together online. It was beautiful. It was exciting. Mapstead saw himself as an explorer in a small but finite kingdom. \u201cI had surfed the entire internet. There wasn\u2019t a page I hadn\u2019t seen.\u201d\n\nAnd then, one day, a company in New York offered to pay him $2,000 a month to put banner ads on one of his websites, and everything changed. More clicks meant more ad dollars. Higher search engine rankings meant more clicks. So whatever it took to get a higher ranking, he learned how to do. He bought photographs of women in bikinis and made a 60-page slideshow with banner ads on each page. He realized that most search engines were just listing websites in order of how many times a search term appeared on the site and in its tags, so he focused on stuffing his sites with keywords, resubmitting his URL to the search engines, and waiting for the results to change.\n\nMapstead started pulling in $25,000\u2013$30,000 a month, working 12- to 14-hour days. \u201cIt was how long could I stay awake and how little life could I have because this was more money than I could have ever imagined in my lifetime,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was like I won the lottery, and I didn\u2019t know how long it would last.\u201d\n\nAround this time, in 1997, an Italian professor published a journal article about what he called Search Engines Persuasion. \u201cFinding the right information on the World Wide Web is becoming a fundamental problem,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA vast number of new companies was born just to make customer Web pages as visible as possible,\u201d which \u201chas led to a bad performance degradation of search engines.\u201d\n\nEnter Google. The company revolutionized search by evaluating websites based on links from other websites, seeing each link as a vote of relevance and trustworthiness. The founders pledged to be a neutral navigation system with no ads: just a clean white screen with a search box that would bring people off of the Google landing page and out to a helpful website as seamlessly as possible. Users quickly decided this link-based sorting methodology was superior to the existing search engines, and by the end of 1999, Google was handling the majority of online queries.\n\n\u201cI was basically just spamming Facebook with cars and articles about cars and sending traffic to banner ads, and that turned into $120,000 a month.\u201d\n\nMapstead, like many of the early practitioners of SEO, figured out how to adapt. Almost as soon as Google took over, a secondary market emerged for links. For a few hundred bucks, a firm in India or the Philippines could provide thousands of links from blog networks built entirely for that purpose. It was easy: buy links that led to your site and watch your ranking in Google\u2019s results rise.\n\nI came to understand that, since the dawn of the internet, there have been people attempting to manipulate search and then people decrying those manipulations as the end of search\u2019s ability to be useful. It works in cycles. People doing SEO find loopholes in the algorithm; critics complain about search results; search engines innovate and close the loopholes. Rinse, repeat.\n\nBefore our current moment of widespread disillusionment with online information, the rise of SEO had reached a breaking point multiple times. In 2003, as Google approached the deadline to disclose pertinent business information leading up to its IPO, the company quietly released an update cracking down. By 2011, SEO was once again oppressively pervasive. TechCrunch published a story called \u201cWhy We Desperately Need a New (and Better) Google,\u201d which argued that \u201cGoogle has become a jungle: a tropical paradise for spammers and marketers.\u201d In the next year, Google made two major changes to the algorithm, which came to be called Panda and Penguin.\n\nWhile the public might have experienced each of these updates as a relief, Mapstead and his SEO compatriots saw them as devastating. \u201cThey change the rules instantly overnight, and then you\u2019re out of business,\u201d he told me. \u201cHere you\u2019re trying to rely on this business model to feed yourself and your family, and they\u2019re pulling the rug from underneath you, and you\u2019ve gotta scramble to pay rent.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t worry about Mapstead. This is a guy seemingly blessed with a never-ending mental stream of schemes. He helped start a handful of companies, including the once-ubiquitous hookup site AdultFriendFinder, which sold in 2007 for $500 million. He tried to retire after that but got bored and started a couple of Facebook pages devoted to his passion for hot rods and custom cars. This was during the peak years for social media, and just as Bastilla had described back at the alligator party, Mapstead\u2019s \u201ccore knowledge of SEO\u201d came in handy. Before long, his pages had 25 million followers. \u201cI was basically just spamming Facebook with cars and articles about cars and sending traffic to banner ads, and that turned into $120,000 a month,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd that was supposed to be my hobby!\u201d\n\nAs I spoke with more SEO professionals around the country, I began to think that the reason I found them endearing and not evil was that while many had made quite a bit of money, almost none had amassed significant power. Unlike the Elon Musks and Jeff Bezoses of the world, who went from geeky teenagers to masters of the universe, the dorks who grew up to do SEO have stayed the butt of the joke, beholden to the fluctuations of the algorithm, frantically pulling levers behind the scenes but ultimately somewhat hapless.\n\nI mean, have I even mentioned that they call themselves \u201cSEOs\u201d? Really. They say things like, \u201cAs the SEO, my job is to get more traffic.\u201d This title feels thirsty to be seen as similar to a CEO, to be taken seriously. And compared to the rest of the tech world, SEO has always lacked a certain glamor or a certain messiah complex. Case in point: while many of the tech CEOs claiming to save the world these days live in Miami, the alligator party was an hour up the coast in Fort Lauderdale.\n\n\u201cThe SEO people are just trying to make money,\u201d said Peter Kent, the author of several dozen explanatory tech books, including SEO for Dummies and Bitcoin for Dummies. \u201cThe cryptocurrency people are trying to make money, but they\u2019re also trying to overthrow, you know, the existing system.\u201d\n\nKent has done his fair share of SEO jobs but also has something of an outsider\u2019s perspective. For years, he\u2019s been telling people that part of the SEO industry\u2019s reputation problem is that 80 percent of SEOs are scammers.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies and individuals out there selling their services as SEO gurus don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing or don\u2019t really give a damn,\u201d he explained. As a consultant, he\u2019s often had businesses ask him to vet the work of other SEOs. \u201cI would take a look at their site and determine the firm had done next to nothing and had been charging thousands a month for years on end.\u201d\n\nWhen I ran this 80 percent scam figure by other SEOs, most agreed it sounded accurate, though people were divided about what to ascribe to greed and what was just stupidity.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t because they have a scammer\u2019s heart,\u201d said Bruce Clay. \u201cIt\u2019s because they don\u2019t have the real expertise.\u201d Clay is an avuncular man with a mustache who is often credited with coining the phrase \u201csearch engine optimization\u201d and is therefore called \u201cthe father of SEO.\u201d He told me his agency never hires an SEO with less than a decade of experience.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can trust anything you read online.\u201d\n\nThough Google publishes guidelines explaining how to do better in search (\u201cMake your site interesting and useful\u201d), the exact formula for how and why one website gets placed over another is top secret, meaning that SEO involves a lot of reverse engineering and guesswork. With no clear chain of cause and effect around why a site\u2019s ranking has changed, a less talented practitioner can take on the mien of a premodern farmer, struggling to figure out how to make it rain. Should he do that dance he did last year the night before it poured? Or maybe sacrifice his firstborn?\n\nThe algorithm is just too opaque, too complicated, and too dynamic, making it easy for scammy SEOs to pretend they know what they\u2019re doing and difficult for outsiders to sort the good SEOs from the bad. To make things even more confusing for, say, a small business looking to hire someone to improve their Google ranking, even a talented SEO might need a year of work to make a difference, perhaps implying a good SEO was a scammer when in fact, the client was just being impatient or refusing to implement essential advice. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of effort that\u2019s required to do things to move the needle, and a lot of companies aren\u2019t willing to put out the money for that, even though it may be worthwhile in the long run,\u201d said John Heard, a longtime SEO based in Kansas.\n\nOf course, some people bristled at the very suggestion that the industry is filled with con artists. \u201cThere are a lot of scammers in every single business. It\u2019s just easier to call yourself an SEO than a doctor,\u201d said Barry Schwartz. Schwartz is an unbelievably fast talker and a prolific writer who has spent the past two decades covering SEO for the trade rag Search Engine Land. Both over the phone with me and in his work, he has defended SEO as a legitimate, dignified pursuit: \u201cThe search community is filled with hard-working individuals working to help their clients\u2019 websites succeed in Google Search. That success is not done through dark, corrupt or shady tactics but rather hard, smart and thorough work.\u201d\n\nSeveral people that I spoke to made a similar point: the best SEOs are the ones that follow Google\u2019s rules, which essentially ask you to make amazing websites without even thinking about Google. You are not supposed to make any attempt to artificially boost a website\u2019s ranking; you are supposed to be designing websites for human readers, not for the algorithm. And many SEOs do exactly this kind of work: rewriting copy, making a site load more quickly, etc. But the existence of good SEOs does not negate the presence of scammers and idiots and people who get ahead by violating Google\u2019s terms of service, just as the mild-mannered teacher\u2019s pet in a classroom does not negate the obnoxious shouting of the kids that refuse to behave. A few loud kids can easily drown everyone else out.\n\nEven Schwartz acknowledged the effect that the rule-breaking SEOs have had on the internet experience. We get to talking about the types of small businesses that are particularly lucrative customers for SEOs, including lawyers, accountants, and contractors, because these are the professions eager for attention from all the people going online to find local recommendations. If Schwartz himself had to hire a reliable attorney, I asked, what would be the best way to do so?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can trust anything you read online,\u201d he told me. \u201cMaybe you ask a friend.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing so much about what it was like to be an SEO, I decided it was time to better understand what\u2019s been going on from the perspective of the search engine. Google was slow to allow someone to talk with me, possibly because of the giant PR clusterfuck that has been the company\u2019s past year (accused by the federal government of being a monopoly; increasingly despised by the public; losing ground to Reddit, TikTok, and large language models), so I decided to start by meeting up with a chipper, charismatic man named Duane Forrester.\n\nForrester was at Microsoft from 2007 until 2015, where he helped launch and manage Bing, the perpetual underdog to Google\u2019s domination of online search. Before and after his time at Microsoft, Forrester worked as an SEO, so he sees the industry from both sides, like an aerospace engineer who spent a few years at the Department of Defense, left for the private sector, and now is much better at winning military contracts. Forrester has a holistic understanding of the delicate push and pull between the SEOs desperate for clues on how to do their jobs better and the search engine trying to keep its secret-sauce algorithm proprietary. He also knows a huge range of people in the industry. Like Schwartz, he wanted to emphasize how hard everyone works. \u201cI\u2019ve lost track of how many people I know who built companies and sold them and have just, like, made wealth,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat is not a 40-hour commitment in the week. That is a 400-hour commitment.\u201d (For the record, there are 168 hours in a week.)\n\nThese days, Forrester lives in Los Angeles, and he asked me to meet him at one of his favorite restaurants, which felt like a British pub operated by Disney World, tucked away in a desert strip mall. Inside, every inch was covered in Anglophile paraphernalia, including Union Jack flags, a mural of Big Ben, and a red phone booth. Over a full English breakfast, he told me about growing up in rural Canada, where his parents owned a motel. As a kid, he used to mess around with the pay phone outside, eventually figuring out how to finagle free long-distance phone calls. \u201cAnd then it became, \u2018What else can I know how to do?\u2019\u201d\n\nBy the \u201990s, Forrester was trading tips with other SEOs in online forums. He still remembers the thrill of the very first SEO conference he went to, where he was asked to speak. \u201cThe people who got up onstage to talk were seen as somehow more knowledgeable, but I don\u2019t know that we felt that way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou all kind of knew you were making shit up.\u201d\n\nAfter years of being friends online, the SEOs were eager to let loose in person, giving off what Forrester described as \u201cthat vibe of a lot of young people with access to a lot of money. And it was like, no expenses spared in New York City.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d\n\nFor Forrester, it was the start of a long career of keynote presentations and consummate schmoozing \u2014 Clay, the father of SEO, described him to me as \u201ca cruise director\u201d on the SS SEO. The conference circuit has treated Forrester well. He\u2019s attended events in Napa, Hawaii, and Barbados, among many others, as well as \u201can infinite number of private dinners and these types of things in every city you can think of, at the most lavish restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve lost track of how many Michelin-starred meals I\u2019ve had, \u2019cause it\u2019s now in the dozens, from my time in this industry. And I\u2019m not going to say no to the dinner that everyone\u2019s going to, that one company is sponsoring because it\u2019s a thank you to everybody who contributed to, whatever it was, you know? And you go and everybody has a good time. You talk about the industry, and that\u2019s it. And it becomes the stuff of legends.\u201d\n\nOver the years, he\u2019s seen it all. He remembered \u201cwalking into hotel rooms and it\u2019s two o\u2019clock in the morning, there\u2019s drugs and alcohol and everything everywhere, and there\u2019s a party going on.\u201d Forrester marveled at the audacity of his fellow SEOs. \u201cSomebody showed up and brought her Aston Martin to a conference and parked it at the front door. Immediately got a parking ticket.\u201d He suggested she might want to relocate the car before it got towed, but the woman told him she would just move it to the next parking spot and get another ticket. \u201cShe goes, \u2018It\u2019s cheaper for me to leave the car parked out front and use it as a way to start conversations with potential clients than it is for me to rent a suite at the hotel and get people to go to the suite to have the same conversation.\u2019\u201d Then, she offered to take Forrester for a joyride around Seattle. Obviously, he said yes.\n\nOnce he represented Bing, Forrester more or less stopped drinking at conferences, as had long been the case for his counterpart at Google, an engineer named Matt Cutts, who helped build and then ran the company\u2019s web spam team before stepping back in 2014 and leaving in 2016.\n\nCutts was a celebrity among SEOs, constantly mobbed with questions and complaints. When we spoke on the phone, he told me that before he left, he determined that he had sent about 50,000 emails to people outside of Google during his decade and a half at the company.\n\nSeveral SEOs described trying to get Cutts to drink at conferences so he would \u201cspill secrets,\u201d as one put it, but what generally ended up happening was that all the SEOs would get drunk instead. Meanwhile, Cutts would stay sober, jotting down the latest SEO methods on a small notepad, sitting quietly in the corner at the bar.\n\n\u201cMy favorite question to ask an SEO,\u201d Cutts told me, was, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d which prompted responses that felt like \u201ca cross between showing off and a confessional.\u201d So many SEOs were tempted to reveal the vulnerabilities they\u2019d discovered in Google\u2019s algorithms, even when they were talking to the one person they really shouldn\u2019t have been talking to, the guy who was planning to go back to his office and make those vulnerabilities disappear.\n\nAs a former SEO himself, Forrester understood that the quality of Bing\u2019s search results would be impacted by the work of SEOs, so it made sense to communicate with SEOs as much as possible. Cutts similarly tried to serve as a conduit between SEOs and Google, but Forrester felt that Google projected an attitude he described as: \u201cWe know what we\u2019re doing, we will stop your attempts to game this, and you know what? We\u2019ll just kind of ignore you, and when you give us feedback, eh, we don\u2019t really care.\u201d\n\nCutts, as an individual, seemed to be doing his best within an expanding corporate behemoth to remain approachable. \u201cOne thing I learned early on was that even when someone was shouting at you, there\u2019s a kernel of something you needed to hear in the other person and listen to and respect and integrate and incorporate,\u201d he told me. Most SEOs told me they appreciated his efforts. When Google released the 2011 Panda update that devastated a generation of SEO businesses, Cutts openly recognized the impossible task of achieving the kind of epistemological neutrality that Google\u2019s founders had initially promised, telling Wired at the time, \u201c[T]he only way to be neutral is either to randomize the links or to do it alphabetically.\u201d\n\nStill, some blamed him personally for \u201ckilling\u201d companies that had relied on the previous iteration of the algorithm. During his time at Google, Cutts regularly received death threats and hate mail. When SEOs would send, say, a fruit plate or a brownie cake addressed to him at Google\u2019s offices, he told me, \u201cWe\u2019d take it down to the kitchen with a note warning: possibly poisoned.\u201d\n\nAfter Cutts left, Google replaced him with a handful of people, none of whom could quite fill his shoes: \u201cThose personalities sometimes were standoffish,\u201d Forrester told me. \u201cSome of them were superior. Some of them were a bit too wallflower.\u201d\n\nOne of the people Google brought in was Danny Sullivan, a former journalist who started Search Engine Land, the industry publication where Schwartz works, back in the 2000s. In 2009, Sullivan was described as \u201cthe closest approximation to an umpire in the search world,\u201d so when he published \u201cA deep look at Google\u2019s biggest-ever search quality crisis\u201d in 2017 and then took a job as Google\u2019s public liaison for Search only a few months later, it felt to some SEOs as though a congressperson working on gun safety legislation had quit to become an NRA lobbyist.\n\n\u201cThere is a thread across the industry of people who believe that Google just made Danny an offer he couldn\u2019t say no to, and it was designed essentially to take his voice out of the conversation,\u201d Forrester told me. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case,\u201d he went on, but compared to Cutts, \u201cI think that Danny specifically stays out of a lot of public conversations because he is in those private conversations with businesses.\u201d\n\nWas all that really Google\u2019s fault? Or the SEOs? Or was this about something deeper and more human: the will to exploit something so much we destroy it.\n\nWhen I finally manage to jump through the flaming rings necessary to be allowed to speak on the phone with Sullivan, albeit with a communications chaperone also on the line, I find him angry and defensive. He\u2019s annoyed that anyone would think his era at Google has been less transparent than Cutts\u2019 was: \u201cWe have reams of help documents!\u201d he told me. \u201cWe have more people assigned to work with SEOs than we did when Matt worked here!\u201d\n\nSullivan is mad that the public and the media don\u2019t really understand what he considers to be basic precepts about how search works, leading him to adopt a rather scolding tone online. He\u2019s frustrated that people want to know every last detail about Google\u2019s algorithm because even \u201cif we listed all one thousand of the ranking signals\u201d and how much each was worth, he said, that wouldn\u2019t actually help SEOs do their jobs better, anyway.\n\nAnd most of all, Sullivan is pissed that people think Google results have gone downhill. Because they haven\u2019t, he insisted. If anything, search results have gotten a lot better over time. Anyone who thought search quality was worse needed to take a hard look in the mirror.\n\n\u201cWe have an entire generation that grew up expecting the search box to do the work for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might do a better job of matching for a bulk of people, but for people who are super sensitive, when they have that fail moment, now it becomes, \u2018All my searches aren\u2019t good.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe problem was not Google. The problem was not SEOs. The problem was kids these days.\n\nOf course Sullivan would say this, though. He works for Google. I felt like I began to understand why many SEOs had told me that Cutts\u2019 departure had marked a major turning point in the history of the internet, emblematic of Google\u2019s transition from idealistic startup to one of the most valuable and powerful companies to ever exist. Over the phone, Cutts came off as humble and thoughtful, acknowledging the nuances and challenges of the search engine business, while Sullivan sounded like an impatient corporate stooge, trying to gaslight me into believing the sky was red.\n\nBut here\u2019s the part where I started to feel the way I\u2019ve felt so often in recent years, like I was losing my grip on reality: Sullivan was not the only person who tried to tell me that search results have improved significantly. Out of the dozen-plus SEOs that I spoke with at length, nearly every single one insisted that search results are way better than they used to be. And except for Sullivan, these were not people with an incentive to praise Google. If anything, these were folks who lamented how much harder it had become for them to take advantage of Google. Today, they told me, search results are just objectively more accurate. More useful. More difficult to manipulate.\n\nThis was not what I had been noticing, and this was certainly not what I had been hearing from friends and journalists and friends who are journalists. Were all of us wrong? Or engulfed in some kind of Baader\u2013Meinhof frequency bias delusion? Had I been researching a nonexistent problem? Were Google results actually amazing? Truly, I had lost the plot. Was the premise of this piece completely off? Was I the asshole who deserved to be attacked by an alligator?\n\nI began to worry all the people who were mad about search results were upset about something that had nothing to do with metrics and everything to do with feelings and ~vibes~ and a universal, non-Google-specific resentment and rage about how the internet has made our lives so much worse in so many ways, dividing us and deceiving us and provoking us and making us sadder and lonelier. Decades of American optimism about the wonderful potential of technology, from the Moon landing to personal computers to the iPhone, had finally, in the last few years, broken down into comprehensive chagrin at the petty, pathetic, and violent world enabled by our devices. Was all that really Google\u2019s fault? Or the SEOs? Or was this about something deeper and more human: the will to exploit something so much we destroy it. To muddy it up, as Babin had put it, but while it worked, to make as much fucking money as possible.\n\nThe person who helped me snap out of my confusion spiral was an SEO named Lily Ray. Ray is a 30-something jet-setter with black-line tattoos and an asymmetrical, dyed blonde pixie cut. I managed to catch her for lunch in Brooklyn between speaking gigs in Chicago and Berlin on a day when she was also simultaneously managing a 35-person team at her digital marketing agency, posting multiple times an hour on social media, dog-sitting for a Pomeranian whose \u201cdaddies\u201d were at Burning Man, caring for her own mini Australian shepherd, and organizing the house party she was hosting that weekend \u2014 a party she expected to be late for because she first had to drop by a rooftop to perform a DJ set at a different party.\n\nRay reassured me that I was not crazy. Google results today do feel different from how they felt just five or six years ago for two major reasons. The first was Google\u2019s response to the disinformation panic around the 2016 election, which involved questioning the notion that the most reliable information could be chosen by a form of popularity, meaning how many links a site received from other sites. As a result, the algorithm seemed to change its approach to links, especially when it came to news and sites offering legal, financial, or health advice, and instead paid more attention to what Google came to call E-E-A-T: experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.\n\n\u201cE-E-A-T has had a pretty big impact on what types of results you see,\u201d Ray told me. She\u2019s done extensive (and fascinating) research around how certain sites have fared under these new guidelines: Urban Dictionary, down! Mayo Clinic, up! Some people consider EEAT part of what\u2019s making results better than ever. Others see it as a form of censorship, disproportionately affecting right-wing perspectives. Not every search query takes EEAT into account; Google has described heightened concern over sites that could impact safety, happiness, and the ability to be an informed citizen. But the point that really hit me was that for certain kinds of information, Google had undone one of the fundamental elements of what had made its results so appealing from the start. Now, instead of wild-west crowdsourcing, search was often reinforcing institutional authority.\n\nYou can\u2019t just be the most powerful observer in the world for two decades and not deeply warp what you are looking at\n\nThis felt complicated at best. When it comes to health and wellness, for example, quackery is often in the eye of the beholder. Everyone knows someone who has struggled with the limits of Western medicine. So much of the original draw of the internet was the opportunity for outlier voices to be heard alongside established experts and elites. Looking back on all that had changed around what first attracted people to Google, from the introduction of ads to the efforts to keep users within the universe of Google products, this seemed to be the last straw.\n\nThe second major reason why Google results feel different lately was, of course, SEO \u2014 specifically, the obnoxious-kid-refusing-to-behave-in-class kind of SEO.\n\n\u201cSEO that goes against Google\u2019s guidelines, it\u2019s not new,\u201d Ray explained. A decade ago, it used to be called \u201cblack hat\u201d SEO, in comparison to the search engine-approved \u201cwhite hat\u201d tactics. And Google has, as Sullivan and many SEOs told me, gotten better over time at catching SEOs playing tricks on the algorithm. Although many of us may have rosy memories of how magical and cool Google seemed in the early days, most SEOs consider the years between 2003 and 2011 to be the boom times, when you could still get a fake corporate website listed above the real corporate website, and you could mess with the search results for a major political figure such that something sexual or racist would come up first.\n\nGoogle is harder to game now \u2014 it\u2019s true. But the sheer volume of SEO bait being produced is so massive and so complex that Google is overwhelmed. \u201cIt\u2019s exponentially worse,\u201d Ray said. \u201cPeople can mass auto-generate content with AI and other tools,\u201d she went on, and \u201cin many cases, Google\u2019s algorithms take a minute to catch onto it.\u201d\n\nThe future that Babin had cackled about at the alligator party was already here. We humans and our pedestrian questions were getting caught up in a war of robots fighting robots, of Google\u2019s algorithms trying to find and stop the AI-enabled sites programmed by SEOs from infecting our internet experience.\n\nEventually, a site filled with computer-generated nonsense designed to maximize SEO will get removed from search results, Ray explained, but while it\u2019s up, the creator might make as much as $50,000 or $100,000 a month. A lot of the people who did this, she said, live cheaply overseas in places like Bali and Chiang Mai. \u201dThey make a bunch of money, that site dies, and they go do it again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a churn and burn strategy. So if people are seeing those results, it can be very frustrating for users \u2018cause it\u2019s like, \u2018This is terrible.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd yet, as much as she despises what this kind of SEO has done to the internet, Ray told me she hesitated to condemn the actual people doing it. \u201cI used to do those types of tactics, so I couldn\u2019t hate on anybody personally,\u201d she said. \u201cIf people have a problem with Google\u2019s results, they have to ask themselves, is it the fault of the SEOs?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr is this Google behaving differently than it used to?\u201d\n\nSullivan had tried to convince me that Google was not behaving differently and, in fact, had not changed its search criteria in any major way for the past 20 years. Google wanted you to make good websites, and that was that. Everyone who tried to rank higher by messing with the algorithm would be blocked. Sullivan even insisted that what these rule-breakers did should not be called SEO: he deemed it all \u201cspam.\u201d What is spam? \u201cSpam is stuff that search engines don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nBut the line between strategies that violate Google\u2019s terms of service and strategies that don\u2019t has always been blurry and inconsistently enforced. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this much tension in the industry in terms of, like, what Google says to do and what people are doing and getting away with,\u201d Ray told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna tell us that this stuff doesn\u2019t work, make it stop working!\u201d\n\nRay seemed like the most reasonable person I had spoken to so far. Sure, she called herself a \u201cthought leader,\u201d and yes, sure, she had changed her last name to improve her personal branding by more closely associating herself with her grandmother\u2019s uncle, the artist Man Ray. Maybe some people would say that\u2019s the kind of absurd behavior that merits being attacked by an alligator, but I was beginning to come down on the side of the SEOs, who seemed to have a lot less agency than I\u2019d first imagined.\n\nGoogle had started with a noble cause: trying to make the internet easier to navigate at scale. The company did accomplish that goal, but in doing so, it inadvertently and profoundly changed how the internet looked. The problem lay in Google trying to be an objective and neutral arbiter of an information landscape that was meant to pretend it did not exist. You cannot design a free, automated system to help people find information without some people trying to game that system. You can\u2019t just be the most powerful observer in the world for two decades and not deeply warp what you are looking at.\n\nFor the past 25 years, the internet as we know it has been almost entirely defined and controlled by Google. What the SEOs do matters for all of us on a daily basis, distorting how we perceive the world in ways we can hardly begin to imagine or understand. Yet any money that any SEO has made is a fraction of a crumb compared to Google\u2019s 10-layer cake. The company brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year, profits that skew Google\u2019s choices and priorities. As Google\u2019s founders wrote back in 1997: \u201cwe expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s Google\u2019s world, and the SEOs are only living in it\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why most countries around the world have libraries that are public institutions: information that is controlled by a private business will always be subject to that business\u2019s bottom line. In the beginning, the internet was seen as an improvement on the spirit of the public library. Here was an opportunity to transcend the gatekeepers controlling who could publish a book, allowing mankind to fully connect and share knowledge. Instead, we have ended up in a situation arguably worse than before, where nearly all online information runs through a single company, which assumes a veneer of civic utility, of impassive authority, when it is very much not a neutral entity.\n\n\u201cThere were so many true believers at Google in the early days,\u201d Cutts told me. \u201cAs companies get big, it gets harder to get things done. Inevitably, people start to think about profit or quarterly numbers.\u201d He claimed that, at least while he was there, search quality always came before financial goals, but he believes that the public underestimates how Google is shaping what they see, saying, \u201cI deeply, deeply, deeply believe search engines are newspaper-like entities, making editorial decisions.\u201d He speculated that the company didn\u2019t want the public to think too hard about how search works because that awareness \u201cencourages regulators and makes people realize, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a lot of money here.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere has always been advertising and polemics from cranks, scammers, and liars. But now we see this stuff surfacing alongside truth, and we can\u2019t tell the difference. We move through our lives with a greater sense of distrust and fear and insecurity. At the end of the day, it\u2019s Google\u2019s world, and the SEOs are only living in it.\n\nAnd as much as I might hate the way the SEOs who don\u2019t follow Google\u2019s rules have altered my online experience, the reality is that most people running a company will break whatever rules they are able to get away with breaking. While Ray herself said she has left behind the guideline-violating tactics of her past, choosing instead to do as Google asks and make high-quality websites that will \u201cmake the internet a better place,\u201d as she put it, that kind of moral standard can be a lot to ask of someone running a business.\n\n\u201cThey want this wholesome thing, and I can understand that. That\u2019d be neat,\u201d said an SEO named Cade Lee. \u201cBut that\u2019s maybe in a world where we don\u2019t have money and greed and things, you know?\u201d\n\nLee was the person I spoke with on the phone before going to the alligator party, the guy who warned me that SEO was \u201cmodern-day pirate shit.\u201d He is among the SEOs who have spoken publicly, on panels, about violating Google\u2019s guidelines. He\u2019s also an ex-con who used to trade penny stocks and served time for securities fraud. His entire body is covered in tattoos, from his scalp to his legs to his fingers. When we met up for beers in Denver at a bar outside an escape room, he told me that his probation officer in the economic crime offenders unit has never tried to stop him from violating Google\u2019s terms of service.\n\n\u201cI was transparent about it, and they approved it,\u201d he said. They even approved \u201csome pretty questionable things, like in regards to adult sites,\u201d he told me, specifically involving what he\u2019d thought were ads for consensual sex workers. Later, an activist reached out and showed him how certain websites he had built were supporting human trafficking. Horrified, he shut the whole thing down, even then helping the activist with her website.\n\nThese days, Lee runs a construction company. His probation officer hates when he phrases it like this, but he thinks any way you make money is essentially a con or a scam of some kind. \u201cThe good con is like, you actually delivered, and you came through and made a profit.\u201d For example: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna take that old lady\u2019s money to build her a brand new patio. There\u2019s that scam, and then there\u2019s, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s take her deposit and run.\u2019\u201d Lee is the kind of guy who has spent a lot of time thinking about his place in the world: what matters, what doesn\u2019t, and how his actions affect other people. He was in the Marines, he sold mortgages in the lead-up to the 2008 crash, he went to prison, he\u2019s done SEO. He understands that he needs to make money to survive, but he\u2019d like to do so in a way that is minimally harmful. So he prefers the good kind of con.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happened with SEO for me \u2014 it was becoming bullshit,\u201d he says. \u201cI was not feeling good about customer meetings and about what I was saying, and I was like, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u2019\u201d"}, {"title": "NFL Best Bets Week 9: Colts clobber Panthers, Dolphins drop Chiefs in Germany", "author": "Sloan Piva", "source": "Sporting News", "published_at": "2023-11-03T20:56:00+00:00", "category": "sports", "url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-best-bets-week-9-spread-moneyline-over-under-props/a1ec41161f82a56561cdac97", "body": "The past few weeks of the 2023 NFL season have reminded us that no matter how smooth you sail to start the voyage, choppy waters will surely come at some point. We started the first six weeks with a best bets winning percentage of well over .700, but we have come crashing back down to Earth over the past two weeks. We love our Week 9 best bets, though, and we're confident that we can all get back on track and make you some cash.\n\nEvery Friday afternoon, we unveil my favorite moneyline, spread, over/under, and player prop wagers for the upcoming weekend. We run the gauntlet and handpick the best value opportunities on Caesars and SuperDraft, then tell you exactly how and why you should attack the books to make some money. And through eight weeks, despite some bumps in the road, we have made plenty of money.\n\nDespite falling three bets under .500 over the past two weeks (5-6 in Week 7, 6-8 in Week 8), our best bets are still 65-46-1 on the season. That's a winning percentage of over .590, a number many professional bettors wish they were maintaining during this rollercoaster of an NFL season.\n\nAnd, look, last week wasn't all bad as Arnold Schwarzenneger might say. Sure, our ATS picks went 1-3 and our player prop picks went a pitiful 0-3. But our moneyline and over/under picks went 5-2. So, like the Chiefs after a pathetic loss to the Broncos (one of our incorrect picks last week), we're moving on to Week 9 with our heads held high.\n\nMORE WEEK 9 BETTING: Against the spread | Moneyline | Top props\n\nWe don't view sports betting as a gamble. With the right mindset, strategies, and preparedness, we see it as an investment \u2014 and we're loving our return on investment through seven weeks. That's why we don't just call this thing of ours a hobby \u2014 rather, it's a second job that allows us to punch in while we're sitting on our couch.\n\nYour goal is to boost your bankroll, and our top priority is to help you achieve that goal. That's why we put in a ton of statistical research, attack all the angles, uncover all the betting trends, and pinpoint value across all the sports betting sites each week.\n\nThis weekend's slate features a plethora of lucrative opportunities for bettors. So, let's go get that money and reveal our best moneyline, spread, over/under, and SuperDraft player prop bets for Week 9 of the 2023 NFL season.\n\nJUMP TO: Spreads | Moneylines | Over/under | Player props\n\nNFL Best Bets Week 9: Against the spread\n\nAll odds courtesy of Caesars Sportsbook\n\nColts (-2.5) at Panthers\n\nBryce Young has looked much better now that he has settled into his rookie season with the Panthers, but Carolina still seems like a work in progress. The Colts, meanwhile, have quietly been operating a pretty decent offense \u2014 much better than their three-game losing streak might suggest. Indy has scored 65 points between Week 7 and 8, 29 more points than Panthers have scored in that span.\n\nIn a Gardner Minshew-Bryce Young battle, we'll take the 'Shew \u2014 and the backfield committee of Jonathan Taylor and Zack Moss against Carolina's abysmal run defense just serves as icing on the proverbial cake. The Panthers have allowed the most rushing TDs (14), the third-most points per game (28.4), and the fourth-most rushing yards per game (139.4) during their 1-7 start. The Colts will cruise in this one.\n\nFINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Colts 27, Panthers 17\n\nSeahawks (+6) at Ravens\n\nBaltimore's defense has been incredible of late, and the Ravens seem to be flying under the radar (so to speak) at 6-2. However, the sportsbooks have clearly taken note of their awesome run, giving the NFC West-leading Seahawks a full touchdown on the road. This seems like a great opportunity for us to rock with the 'dog, considering Seattle has won two straight contests and gone 2-1 on the road (including a big win over the high-flying Lions in Detroit).\n\nGeno Smith hasn't been the same Pro Bowl QB as he was in 2022, but he has still demonstrated moments of brilliance for Pete Carroll's squad. And with DK Metcalf and Kenneth Walker III a week closer to full health \u2014 and backup RB Zack Charbonnet looking like he's on the verge of a breakout \u2014 we like Seattle to at least make this a game in Baltimore. The 'Hawks defense has quietly been pretty good, and we know what kind of fireworks this offense is capable of when everything's clicking. Take an extra 1.5 points as insurance if you want, but we're taking the Seahawks to cover the +6.\n\nFINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Ravens 26, Seahawks 23\n\nOther Week 9 spreads we like: Patriots (-3) vs. Commanders; Raiders -1.5 vs. Giants\n\nBest NFL moneyline bets Week 9\n\nDolphins (+110) vs. Chiefs (Germany game)\n\nWe get it \u2014 the Dolphins have yet to defeat a true contender this season and the Chiefs are the reigning champions of the NFL. However, Kansas City just got its doors blown off by Russell Wilson and the lowly Broncos, a game in which Patrick Mahomes and company suffered five turnovers and three sacks.\n\nWe expect a statement win from Mike McDaniel and the Dolphins on neutral ground. The Dolphins have been in Frankfurt since early this week, having flown overnight on Monday to give them multiple days to acclimate to the time difference and their surroundings. The Chiefs, meanwhile, waited until after practice on Thursday to take the 11-hour voyage.\n\nThis also happens to be a revenge game for former Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill, who's on pace for multiple single-season receiving records and poised for his first Offensive Player of the Year award. Oh, and Raheem Mostert, who leads the NFL with 10 TDs and ranks second behind only Breece Hall in yards per carry (5.4), should be licking his chops against a Kansas City D that has surrendered 135.6 rushing yards per game over the past three weeks. Fins up in Frankfurt!\n\nFINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Dolphins 26, Chiefs 24\n\nOther Week 9 moneylines we like: Vikings (+170) at Falcons; Bengals (-130) vs. Bills; Cowboys (+140) at Eagles\n\nBest NFL over/under bets Week 9\n\nRaiders vs. Giants: UNDER 37.5\n\nIt sounds ludicrous to offer an UNDER of 37.5 as a best bet, but this game takes the cake in a Week 9 schedule loaded with underwhelming matchups. The Raiders just fired their head coach and GM and demoted starting QB Jimmy Garoppolo after appearing lost on Monday night, while the Giants just got Daniel Jones back after scoring a combined 33 points across three miserable performances in a row. Oh, and Darren Waller, the G-men's best pass-catcher, is hurt.\n\nOn top of all that, the Giants and Raiders have both been pretty good on the defensive side of the football as of late, so expect Danny Dimes and Aidan O'Connell to have a tough time finding any kind of rhythm in the passing game. This won't be a fun one to watch, but it should be a fun result for UNDER bettors.\n\nFINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Raiders 17, Giants 13\n\nOther Week 9 over/unders we like: Colts at Panthers: OVER 44; Commanders at Patriots: OVER 41; Saints OVER 25.5 vs. Bears\n\nMORE BETTING:\n\nPick'em, Survivor Pool Picks | Chiefs-Dolphins preview | Chargers-Jets MNF preview\n\nBest NFL player prop bets Week 9\n\nWin BIG with SuperDraft! Get a free $10 deposit when you use promo code \"TSN\"!\n\nRashee Rice, Chiefs vs. Dolphins in Germany \u2014 OVER 45.5 receiving yards\n\nAs soon as I opened up my SuperDraft app, Rashee Rice popped out as the first prop of the first game on Sunday morning (9:30 a.m. in Frankfurt). We love this rookie receiver and the big play ability he has consistently flashed over the past month. During that span, he has averaged over 55 receiving yards per game despite the Chiefs' games being decided by an average of 11.8 points per game.\n\nMORE SUPERDRAFT DFS & FANTASY PROPS: How to play SuperDraft\n\nThis one should be a tightly-contested, high-scoring game \u2014 with heavy playoff implications, because we all know this could be an AFC Championship preview \u2014 so expect Rice to be very busy through all four frames in Frankfurt. The Dolphins have allowed the fifth-most receptions and the 12th-most yards to wideouts this season. If a bounce-back week is meant to be, Sir Rashee is our destiny.\n\nAustin Ekeler, RB, Chargers @ Jets \u2014 OVER 29.5 receiving yards\n\nGuess who's back? Back again...Ek is back....tell a friend. The Chargers finally got their best player back to full health, with Ekeler exploding for 123 yards and a TD against the Bears last weekend. A whopping 94 of those 123 yards came through the air, as the PPR god gashed Chicago for chunk yardage a handful of times.\n\nExpect more of the same from QB Justin Herbert and his stud back against the Jets, who have allowed 46 receiving yards per game to RBs (sixth-most in the NFL). They'll try to shut him down this Sunday, but it would feel so empty without AE!\n\nJahan Dotson, WR, Commanders @ Patriots \u2014 OVER 45.5 receiving yards\n\nWe've come full circle with Dotson, who made our preseason sleepers column then faded into early-season obscurity only to emerge again over the past two weeks. Curtis Samuel was clearly not right last week, and the second-year wideout more than made up for it. Dotson caught 8-of-10 targets for 108 yards and a TD, a stellar encore to his Week 7 line of five catches for 43 yards. The banged-up Patriots defense will be primarily focused on stopping stud Commanders receiver Terry McLaurin, which should open up plenty of opportunities for Dotson."}, {"title": "Bringing aqueous rechargeable zinc iodine batteries to the mainstream energy market", "author": "Robert Lea", "source": "Advanced Science News", "published_at": "2023-09-26T11:50:40+00:00", "category": "science", "url": "https://www.advancedsciencenews.com/bringing-aqueous-rechargeable-zinc-iodine-batteries-to-the-mainstream-energy-market/", "body": "New research aims to improve the stability and safety of alternatives to rechargeable lithium-ion batteries using aqueous zinc and hydrogels.\n\nThe demand for rechargeable batteries as a result of the growth of both the personal electronics and electric vehicle markets has grown steadily over the last decade. Lithium-ion batteries are one of the technologies that have emerged and matured due to this demand.\n\nIn 2020, Statista estimated that lithium-ion batteries accounted for 185 gigawatts (GWh) of energy consumed, and this energy demand is projected to reach 2,035 GWh by 2030. Most of this growth is accounted for by the increased desire for electric vehicles as people turn away from fossil fuels.\n\nWhile it is undeniable that lithium-ion batteries are more environmentally friendly than fossil fuels and while they are also relatively inexpensive, these batteries aren\u2019t perfect. One of the major drawbacks of these lithium-ion batteries is the inherent risk of burning or even explosion as the result of thermal runaway, with overheated lithium-ion batteries deemed responsible for a number of fires in the past.\n\nA possibility with zinc\n\nOne potential substitute for lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable zinc iodine batteries , which have the advantage of being safer, costing less, and being more friendly to the environment than lithium alternatives.\n\nHowever, zinc iodine batteries are not perfect. Composed of an negative iodine electrode and a positive zinc electrode , these batteries suffer from issues like lower energy output compared to commercial non-aqueous lithium batteries and the growth of zinc dendrites on the anodes \u2014 projections of material that build on electrodes and short batteries when they cross from one electrode to another \u2014 as well as the corrosion of the zinc anode that result in reduced efficiency and even short-circuiting.\n\nIn a new paper published in the journal Advanced Materials, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences professor Hongjin Fan and his co-authors examine different electrolytes for aqueous zinc ion batteries that take the form of hydrogels \u2014 three-dimensional network structures that are capable of storing large amounts of water \u2014 to address some of these challenges.\n\n\u201cThe core concept of our research is that we design the hydrogel electrolytes by introducing functional groups [specific groupings of atoms within molecules that have their own characteristic properties] that carry either positive or negative charges,\u201d Fan said. \u201cOur idea is to use a hetero-hydrogel to mitigate challenges on both the anode and the cathode sides of the zinc iodine batteries.\u201d\n\nA hydrogel boost\n\nFan explained that the purpose of this hydrogel modification is to ensure that when zinc accumulates on the anode side, it does so evenly. This has the effect of mitigating the diffusion back and forth of polysulfide between anode and cathode, the so-called \u201cshuttle effect\u201d, which can cause poor cycling stability and severe anode corrosion in batteries. The use of a hydrogel electrolyte also has the effect of accelerating the iodine conversion reaction on the cathode side.\n\nFan explained that the anode and cathode of the hydrogel have different functional groups that make it both zincophilic (with an affinity for zinc ) and iodophilic ( with an affinity for iodine), respectively.\n\nOn the anode side of the battery, this has the effect of repelling dissolved polyiodides \u2014 negatively charged ions composed entirely of iodine atoms \u2014 allowing the zinc to be deposited uniformly, protecting the anode from iodine-caused corrosion.\n\nThe polyiodides are immobilized at the cathode side of the battery, and reactions in which iodine is both stripped of electrons (oxidization) and also granted electrons (reduction) \u2014 so-called \u201credox reactions\u201d \u2014 are sped up thanks to the synchronized rapid transport of ions and electrons.\n\nThe solid nature of the hydrogel electrolyte can also limit the growth of dendrites thanks to its mechanical strength, which acts as a physical barrier not present in liquid electrolytes.\n\nTentative first steps\n\nTesting their aqueous hydrogel-modified zinc iodine batteries battery, the team found that the decay rate was ultralow, with the energy storage capacity of the battery retained to an outstanding level over the course of 18,000 discharge and recharge cycles. This outstrips the stability of currently available zinc iodine batteries, and their test battery also delivered some surprising results.\n\n\u201cThe adhesion between the polyanionic and polycationic hydrogel components is remarkably robust, effectively mitigating the swelling of the hydrogel even in the absence of a cellulose paper scaffold,\u201d Fan explained. \u201cThe unexpectedly strong iodine adsorption capability of the positively charged hydrogel has led to a striking and rapid color transformation, exceeding our initial expectations.\n\nDespite promising results, Fan acknowledged there is much to do before the battery can be brought to the mass market.\n\n\u201cWe have to note that in terms of mass or volume energy density, so far, the ZIB is still far from the commercial lithium-ion batteries,\u201d Fan conceded. \u201cThe hydrogel electrolytes need to be further improved in terms of ion conductivity and stability. In addition, hydrogel electrolytes should be compatible with other battery components, including electrodes and separators.\u201d\n\nThe researcher also pointed out that large-scale and cost-effective production methods for hydrogel electrolytes are a prerequisite before the aqueous zinc iodine batteries is ready for widescale commercial use. This will include optimizing the production process of hydrogels as well as sourcing affordable raw materials and minimizing waste generated during the manufacturing of these materials.\n\n\u201cEnsuring the safety and reliability of hydrogel-based batteries is also necessary,\u201d Fan concluded. \u201cRigorous testing and evaluation of the potential environmental impact of hydrogel electrolytes, from raw material extraction to disposal, are vital to meeting sustainability goals and gaining public trust.\u201d\n\nReference: Peihua Yang, Hong Jin Fan, et al., Hetero-Polyionic Hydrogels Enable Dendrites-Free Aqueous Zn-I2 Batteries with Fast Kinetics, Advanced Materials, (2023).

The episode resurfaced after a source claimed to Yahoo Entertainment that Swift and Travis Kelce \u201chave talked about kids\u201d within the next year.\n\nIn the episode of his podcast, the Philadelphia Eagles star asked his mother, Donna, which of her two sons she was \u201crooting for,\u201d as the Eagles and Chiefs were preparing to play against each other in the Super Bowl at the time.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve said in the past to both of us that you root for me because I\u2019ve given you grandkids,\u201d Jason, who shares three children \u2013 Wyatt, four, Elliotte, two, and Bennett, seven months \u2013 with wife Kylie Kelce, said. \u201cI\u2019ve always known that you root for Travis. So who do you actually root for?\u201d\n\nAfter Jason asked his mother again who she was rooting for, \u201cif in a battle to the death,\u201d Donna responded by asking who he\u2019d pick to save if she and her husband, Ed Kelce, were stranded in the middle of the ocean. While Donna said she couldn\u2019t pick which of her sons to root against, Jason then joked: \u201cRemember if you choose me, Wyatt and Elliotte grow up without a father.\u201d\n\nTravis then chimed in to joke about wanting to start his own family. \u201cI gotta start breeding,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta start breeding, to all the breeders out there.\u201d\n\nJason then responded to his brother\u2019s remark with: \u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d before Donna advised: \u201cWait until you find the right person. Find the right person.\u201d\n\nHowever, Travis still doubled down on his plan, as he quipped: \u201cI\u2019m gonna find a breeder, and I\u2019m gonna get kids so that mom can love me again.\u201d\n\nOn X, formerly known as Twitter, fans have called Travis out for his seemingly sexist remarks and claimed that he shouldn\u2019t have been referring to women as \u201cbreeders\u201d.\n\n\u201cForever grateful that Joe Alwyn kept to himself and is private,\u201d one wrote, referring to Swift\u2019s ex-boyfriend of six years.\u201cIt\u2019s what makes Travis Kelce\u2019s statements from earlier this year about \u2018finding a breeder\u2019 cringe. You are free to say what you want but are not free from the consequences of doing so. Women are not objects.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Start breeding,\u2019 oh this is just f***ing disgusting and it\u2019s setting us back so much,\u201d another added. \u201cWomen aren\u2019t baby-making machines, women are more than the man they\u2019re dating, we are more than marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t a Swiftie but don\u2019t have to be one to be weirded out about Travis Kelce calling women \u2018breeders,\u2019\u201d someone else wrote. \u201cThat ain\u2019t it dude.\u201d\n\nMany other people went on to criticise claims about Swift and Travis having children soon, since the singer is about to return to her Eras Tour until November 2024.\n\n\u201cWell I know for DAMN SURE that s*** about \u2018having kids within the next year\u2019 is NOT coming from Taylor\u2019s side,\u201d one claimed. \u201cShe\u2019s got the Eras Tour booked all through next year, and she\u2019d rather die than cancel a show. But we do know who\u2019s been public about looking for a \u2018BREEDER.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe comments about Travis and Swift\u2019s romance came days after they seemingly confirmed their relationship. On 22 October, Swift made her return to Arrowhead Stadium to watch as the Kansas City Chiefs won their game against the Los Angeles Chargers. The occasion marked Swift\u2019s fourth time attending one of Kelce\u2019s games, amid ongoing reports that they are dating.\n\nFollowing the event, Chariah Gordon, the partner of Kelce\u2019s teammate Mecole Hardman Jr, took to Instagram to share a snap of the singer and NFL player\u2019s sweet PDA moment. In the picture, Swift could be seen standing next to Kelce, reaching to kiss his cheek.\n\nIn addition to the kiss, the football star also had the perfect reaction to a fan calling him Swift\u2019s boyfriend. After a fan shouted: \u201cLet\u2019s go Taylor\u2019s boyfriend\u201d while Kelce was waiting for an elevator, he responded with a small smile on his face and by pumping his fist into the air.\n\nAside from their appearances at sports events, Swift and Kelce have also been photographed together on other occasions, including a date earlier this month in New York City after their surprise appearances on the season 49 premiere of Saturday Night Live. At the time, sources alleged to Entertainment Tonight that, during the date, Kelce got a little too close to Swift\u2019s security personnel and allegedly told her bodyguard to step aside.\n\nHowever, during an episode of his podcast, Kelce explained what he said to the security, and clarified that he didn\u2019t push the bodyguard. \u201cI placed my hand on the gentleman\u2019s back to let him know I was behind him. If I would have pushed him, he probably would have turned around and tased me,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Independent has contacted representatives for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce for contact."}, {"title": "Sony Music\u2019s artists aren\u2019t involved in YouTube\u2019s new voice-cloning AI experiment.

MBW Explains is supported by JKBX , a technology platform that offers consumers access to music royalties as an asset class.\n\nAs we said last week: Welcome to the future.\n\nSeven days ago (November 16), YouTube unveiled a revolutionary new experiment \u2013 \u2018Dream Track\u2019 \u2013 enabling creators to clone the vocals, via AI tech and with official consent, of well-known stars.\n\nCharlie Puth\u2019s voice is on there. John Legend\u2019s voice is on there. Demi Lovato\u2019s voice is on there.\n\nIn fact, the voices of a number of well-known recording artists signed to Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group \u2013 or labels within each major \u2013 are on there.\n\nYet something conspicuous is not on there: any endorsement whatsoever from the world\u2019s second-biggest recording company, Sony Music Entertainment, or its artists.\n\nWhy is Sony missing?\n\nMBW understands that Sony Music (the recorded music arm of Sony Music Group) has, like Universal and Warner, been in discussions for months with YouTube over potentially licensing the \u2018Dream Track\u2019 experiment.\n\nDuring this period of discussion, YouTube has made a number of positive announcements regarding the biggest issue for any rightsholder regarding AI-driven voice replication of artists: their ability to police it.\n\nIn August, YouTube and Universal Music Group jointly announced that the video platform was launching an \u2018AI Music Incubator\u2019 \u2013 a program by which new tools and innovations will be developed at YouTube in close conjunction with artists and the music biz. To progress this \u2018incubator\u2019, YouTube said it was working behind the scenes with a number of UMG-affiliated artists;\n\nand jointly announced that the video platform was launching an \u2013 a program by which new tools and innovations will be developed at YouTube in close conjunction with artists and the music biz. To progress this \u2018incubator\u2019, YouTube said it was working behind the scenes with a number of UMG-affiliated artists; Also in August, YouTube publicly committed to three principles/pledges behind its development of music-based generative AI tools . These pledges promised \u201cappropriate protections\u2026 for music partners who decide to participate\u201d in said tools. They promised \u201cinvest[ment] in the AI-powered technology\u201d that, amongst other things, would help YouTube \u201cprotect our community of viewers, creators, artists and songwriters\u2026 [from] trademark and copyright abuse\u201d .

These pledges promised in said tools. They promised that, amongst other things, would help YouTube . This all seemed to hint at a desire to build a on YouTube to control and police content made by cloning artists\u2019 voices; Then, earlier this month, YouTube announced it was developing a specific system for music partners that allowed them to request the removal of content on its platform that \u201cmimics an artist\u2019s unique singing or rapping voice\u201d.\n\nEvidently, all of this was enough for Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group to dip their toe into the \u2018Dream Track\u2019 experiment \u2013 though not without caution.\n\nSir Lucian Grainge, Chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group, said of UMG\u2019s decision to offer a limited license to \u2018Dream Track\u2019: \u201cWe have a fundamental responsibility to our artists to ensure the digital ecosystem evolves to protect them and their work against unauthorized exploitation, including by generative AI platforms.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we must help artists achieve their greatest creative and commercial potential \u2013 in part by providing them access to the kind of opportunities and cutting-edge creative tools made possible by AI.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a fundamental responsibility to our artists to ensure the digital ecosystem evolves to protect them and their work against unauthorized exploitation, including by generative AI platforms.

These artists are being offered the choice to lean in, and we\u2019re pleased to experiment and find out what the creators come up with.\u201d\n\nWhy, then, did Sony Music not join its rivals in granting YouTube and \u2018Dream Track\u2019 access to any of its active artists\u2019 licensed voices?\n\nEspecially when SME has shown its own willingness to experiment with generative AI music platforms this week via this announcement about a project with David Gilmour, The Orb, and AI company Vermillio?\n\nSources close to Sony Music\u2019s HQ in New York have suggested to MBW that the company is taking an \u201cartist-led\u201d approach to its experiments with any AI platform that can manipulate the work (or voice) of its roster.\n\nIn the case of YouTube\u2019s \u2018Dream Track\u2018, MBW understands, SME first offered the opportunity to participate to a number of its artists, but this group of acts did not show enthusiasm about participating.\n\n(If one of these artists was Bad Bunny, signed to Sony\u2019s The Orchard, you can see why: The Puerto Rican superstar expressed fury the other week about a popular track on TikTok that had cloned his vocal stylings via AI.)\n\nBut last month something else happened that, we hear, effectively scuppered any chance that Sony Music would get involved with \u2018Dream Track\u2019 at this juncture.\n\nOn October 30, Google \u2013 the parent of YouTube within Alphabet Inc. \u2013 issued a filing with the US Copyright Office that outlined its core position on \u2018Artificial Intelligence and Copyright\u2019.\n\nThe contents of this document have caused some alarm at Sony Music HQ.\n\nWhat was in the Google document?\n\nYou may have read on MBW last week that Ed Newton-Rex \u2013 a generative AI pioneer, but also a published composer \u2013 decided to quit his role at Stability AI over concerns over the company\u2019s position on \u201cfair use\u201d within its own recent US Copyright Office filing.\n\n\u2018Fair use\u2019 is, as it sounds, the argument that there are cases where copyrighted material can be used and even replicated that are, well, fair enough.\n\nA clumsy example: I read a great book, then I meet you for breakfast, where I tell you about the story and quote a couple of my favorite passages to you.\n\nTo suggest I\u2019ve just committed copyright infringement wouldn\u2019t only be silly \u2013 it would mean that copyright protections were getting in the way of the commercial furtherment of the author/rightsholder (i.e. you might go and buy the book on my recommendation).\n\nGoogle\u2019s submission to the USCO contains a number of passages that posit a similar position\u2026 but for generative AI models. The document argues that the ingestion of copyrighted material for the training of generative AI platforms shouldn\u2019t be hampered by copyright law.\n\nYou can read the full Google USCO submission here, but below are a few of the choicest sections on this topic:\n\n\u201cThe doctrine of fair use [within existing US copyright law] provides that copying for a new and different purpose is permitted without authorization where \u2014 as with training Al systems \u2014 the secondary use is transformative and does not substitute for the copyrighted work .\u201d\n\n[within existing US copyright law] provides that copying for a new and different purpose is permitted without authorization where \u2014 as with \u2014 the secondary use is transformative and .\u201d \u201cIf [AI] training could be accomplished without the creation of copies, there would be no copyright questions here. Indeed that act of \u201cknowledge harvesting\u201d\u2026 like the act of reading a book and learning the facts and ideas within it , would not only be non-infringing , it would further the very purpose of copyright law. The mere fact that, as a technological matter, copies need to be made to extract those ideas and facts from copyrighted works should not alter that result .\u201d\n\ncould be accomplished without the creation of copies, there would be no copyright questions here. Indeed that act of \u201cknowledge harvesting\u201d\u2026 like the , would not only be , it would further the very purpose of copyright law. The mere fact that, as a technological matter, .\u201d \u201cSome might object to this logic in the context of generative Al systems, arguing that even if such a system produces content that is not substantially similar to any of the content it was trained on, the output of that model might compete in the marketplace with works used for training or, more broadly, with the authors of those works \u2026 This argument misunderstands both the nature of the fair use inquiry and the creative markets that copyright is intended to protect. Even if generative-Al-assisted outputs do compete with existing works that were used in training, or with future works by the authors of those works, the pro-competitive nature of copying for the purpose of \u201cknowledge harvesting\u201d has traditionally been a reason to favor a holding of fair use , not a reason to reject it.\u201d\n\nthe output of that model might \u2026 Even if generative-Al-assisted outputs do compete with existing works that were used in training, or with future works by the authors of those works, the pro-competitive nature of copying for the purpose of \u201cknowledge harvesting\u201d has traditionally been a reason to , not a reason to reject it.\u201d And then the kicker: \u201cAny prohibition or limitation on the use of copyrighted materials for purposes of Al training would therefore undermine the purpose of copyright and foreclose the many opportunities that come with this technology.\u201d\n\nTo be fair to Google, its submission does make note of the importance of US copyright law, including when applied to generative AI, striking \u201cthe right balance between the legitimate interests of rightsholders and the equally legitimate interests of the public and succeeding generations of creators\u201d.\n\nYet it could clearly be argued that Google\u2019s take on copyright \u201charvesting\u201d by generative AI models sits in odd contrast to the copyright-related reassurances that YouTube has been careful to make to the music industry during the pre-development, development, and trial launch of \u2018Dream Track\u2019.\n\nA final thought\u2026\n\nMBW\u2019s sources close to Sony Music were keen to point out that the company\u2019s general ongoing relationship with YouTube and YouTube Music is a harmonious one.\n\n(YouTube is, after all, now the second largest commercial partner of the major record companies \u2013 with a stated ambition to catch up with Spotify in the years ahead. YouTube says it paid out over USD $6 billion to music rightsholders in the year to end of June 2022, with around $2 billion of that coming just from ads on user-generated content.)\n\nHowever, the October US Copyright Office filing from Google has definitely put the cat amongst the pigeons at Sony Music HQ. As we\u2019re sure it has at the other two major record companies.\n\n\u201cAny prohibition or limitation on the use of copyrighted materials for purposes of Al training would undermine the purpose of copyright and foreclose the many opportunities that come with this technology.\u201d Google filing with the US Copyright Office, October 30\n\nWitness Universal Music Group\u2019s own filing with the US Copyright Office on the topic of AI. It couldn\u2019t offer a starker contrast to Google\u2019s assertion that \u201cprohibition or limitation on the use of copyrighted materials for purposes of Al training would undermine the purpose of copyright and foreclose the many opportunities that come with this technology\u201d.\n\n(Example from UMG\u2019s filing: \u201cThe wholesale appropriation of UMG\u2019s enormous catalog of copyright-protected sound recordings and musical compositions to build multibillion commercial enterprises [in AI] is anything but fair use.\u201d)\n\nAs well as part-explaining Sony Music\u2019s refusal to be included in \u2018Dream Track\u2019 thus far, Google\u2019s USCO filing also perhaps explains the careful words selected by Robert Kyncl and especially Sir Lucian Grainge in their respective comments endorsing YouTube\u2019s AI experiment.\n\n(Grainge\u2019s statement, remember, began: \u201cWe have a fundamental responsibility to our artists to ensure the digital ecosystem evolves to protect them and their work against unauthorized exploitation, including by generative AI platforms\u2026\u201d)\n\nOne interesting final observation on the clutch of artists who agreed, with their record companies, to enter the YouTube \u2018Dream Track\u2019 trial?\n\nThey\u2019re stars, for sure. But in both the case of Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group, they\u2019re \u2013 currently anyway \u2013 not the biggest megastars on either company\u2019s books.\n\nYou might not expect, at this early stage, for the likes of UMG to put forward Drake, Taylor Swift, or The Beatles \u2013 or for WMG to put forward Ed Sheeran or Dua Lipa \u2013 to be guinea pigs in any early AI music experiments, even if they\u2019re run by \u2018friends\u2019 of the music industry like YouTube.\n\nYou might, then, also understandably wonder if there have been significant licensing payments made by YouTube to UMG and WMG for the right to play with the AI vocals of artists who have signed off on \u2018Dream Track\u2019 thus far. And, if so, if these payments are being placed against any as-yet-unrecouped advances that some of these artists may have on their label accounts.\n\nMore broadly, you might ponder a bigger question.\n\nWhen the day comes that YouTube asks the world\u2019s biggest superstars to wholeheartedly embrace \u2018Dream Track\u2019, will Google\u2019s recent US Copyright Office filing give said superstars \u2013 and their record companies \u2013 pause for thought?\n\nJKBX (pronounced \"Jukebox\") unlocks shared value from things people love by offering consumers access to music as an asset class \u2014 it calls them Royalty Shares.

Clearly, we are talking about a very significant event, but the fog of war makes it hard to estimate its full consequences. The main index on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, the Tel Aviv 35, fell 6.4% over the week.\n\nProf. Leo Leiderman, chief economic adviser at Bank Hapoalim and a professor of economics at Tel Aviv University, sets out for \"Globes\" his proposals for rehabilitating the economy and repairing the damage that the war will cause.\n\nWhat has been going through your mind in these first days of the war?\n\n\"What most preoccupies me is not the economy but concern for the families of the soldiers, the wounded, and the captives, and solidarity with them. I have four relatives from Kibbutz Nir Oz who are still missing, and we have no information about them. I find it hard to understand how a war like this landed on us in a country as powerful as Israel. But we have no choice but to win.\"\n\nAs for the effect of the war on economic activity, Leiderman says: \"First of all, the duration and character of the war will have a decisive impact on the depth of damage to the economy. Many studies, as well as past experience, indicate that the longer the war lasts, the broader will be the impact on the economy. It is also known that this connection between the length of the fighting and the economic damage might not be linear. And of course, the more the war widens to more fronts, the greater will be the economic damage.\"\n\nDo you have a forecast for the consequences of the war for economic growth?\n\n\"It\u2019s too early to make a quantitative estimate of the effects on the growth of the economy in 2024 and 2025. We have a great deal of information about loss of growth and product in various episodes in the past, such as the Yom Kippur War, the Lebanon War, two intifadas, various military operations, and the Covid pandemic.\n\n\"We see this is a completely different episode, however. This is a new situation that has no precedent as far as the damage to the economy is concerned. There\u2019s a whole spectrum of possible scenarios, from a short war on the southern front only, to the nightmare scenario of a prolonged war with additional sectors involved. We are only in the fifth day of the war, and it\u2019s to be hoped that the picture will start to become clearer.\"\n\nWhich industries will be hit by the war?\n\n\"A substantial decline can be expected in private consumption, particularly of services. This is not just because of the damage to output and income, but also for psychological reasons. Distress, uncertainty, the possibility of prolonged reserve duty by some of the public - all these things will affect consumer sentiment. Alongside this, tourism, commerce, transport services, entertainment, and restaurants will be hurt. As in the Covid pandemic, the self-employed and small and medium-size businesses may be hurt, particularly those that operate with high leverage.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Bank of Israel announced a dramatic plan to sell $30 billion of its foreign currency reserves to stabilize the shekel. The shekel has in fact recovered slightly, and is traded at around NIS 3.96/$.\n\nWhat\u2019s your view of the Bank of Israel\u2019s move in the foreign exchange market?\n\nLeiderman: \"It\u2019s important to welcome the Bank of Israel\u2019s decision to intervene, as necessary, in the foreign exchange market, in order to ensure the market\u2019s regular operation. The decision to extend the term of Amir Yaron as governor of the bank at least for the duration of the war, and I hope beyond that, is also a stabilizing factor. The banking system is stable, and there is enough liquidity in the system. The behavior of the investment community in Israel, including the financial institutions, indicates high confidence in the economy\u2019s resilience and financial strength. It\u2019s important to maintain a level-headed, correct economic policy that will preserve this \u2018asset.\u2019\"\n\nWhat about the economic cost of the war?\n\n\"As with any war, the current war has and will have direct and indirect impacts. The war will substantially raise defense spending in the coming years, for procurement of equipment, ammunition, and advanced systems in accordance with the new needs. Another direct expense is payment for the reserve duty days of those mobilized. Given current interest rate levels around the world, the cost of servicing public debt as a proportion of GDP will rise. Besides all this, there will be a decline in state revenues from taxation and a rise in the fiscal deficit.\"\n\nHow can this larger deficit be financed?\n\n\"It\u2019s reasonable to argue that besides the hope of financing part of the deficit through aid from the US (President Biden approved $8 billion military aid this week, H. S.), and that will happen, it\u2019s permissible for a country at war to raise its fiscal deficit by what is seen as the right amount. This is in order to ensure that the economy functions properly, to carry out rehabilitation actions, and to prepare for recovery and a return to growth in the near future.\"\n\nHow high should the deficit go?\n\n\"I mean a deficit of 3% of GDP, or 5%, or 8% - there are no sacred numbers. As was said during the Covid pandemic, the state has to do whatever it takes to achieve these goals. Nevertheless, it\u2019s important to make sure that the growth in expenditure and in the deficit is temporary, until economic activity gets back to normal. I\u2019m also sure that there are various budget items that were approved that don\u2019t support economic growth, and that don\u2019t need to be implemented in the new reality. Such a policy will be accepted with complete understanding by investors overseas and in Israel, and also by the credit rating agencies.\"\n\nWhat else do you propose on the economic policy plane?\n\n\"Despite the uncertainty over how the war will develop, alongside an emergency budget, this is the time to start preparing a general economic plan with a strategy for rehabilitating the economy after the war. It\u2019s important to start planning professionally and in detail all aspects of rehabilitating the settlements that have been damaged or destroyed in the south, rehabilitation of infrastructure, the health system, and the civilian systems that need attention.\"\n\nHow do you propose doing this?\n\n\"One possibility is to task the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance Budgets Division with coordinating the work, with help from the various research institutes and economists, engineers, and professionals in academic institutions and in the private sector. It\u2019s important to talk to the private sector, and to understand in every place and every industry what the main damage is and what they need in order to get back to normal. It should be done professionally, preferably with no politicization of the recommendations.\"\n\nWhat do you think the Bank of Israel should do in its next interest rate decision, on October 23?\n\n\"It\u2019s still to early to tell how the war will affect the rate of inflation in the short and medium term. Just as there are new inflationary factors, such as the depreciation of the shekel, there will also be factors working in the opposite direction, given the expected decline in private consumption, tourism, and other items.\n\n\"As with fiscal policy, here too a country at war is allowed to deviate temporarily from the set inflation target. At the moment there is no surge in inflation expectations, and the investment community is aware of the existence of index-linked assets and the exchange rate that can assist in hedging inflation risk.\n\n\"As for cutting the interest rate, it\u2019s too early to consider that. The current interest rate is at the right level for the state of the economy, and together with the policy on exchange rates, it contributes to ensuring financial stability,\" Leiderman concludes.\n\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on October 12, 2023.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2023."}, {"title": "Rollback Policy, a Boon or a Curse?

So a change is necessary to address the issue. Otherwise, the golf courses need to be perpetually extended. Not us. This is the opinion of both Royal & Ancient (R&A) and United States Golf Association (USGA) officials who decided it\u2019s time to bring in the golf ball rollback policy. According to them, with new technologies, golf balls are covering far more distance, resulting in lengthening the courses and incurring a greater financial burden on the golf clubs. Moreover, there are a growing number of voices who feel golf has become way less competitive nowadays.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\n\nOn the other hand, there is a chance this might create bifurcation, which no one likes. The rules are non-binding in nature. So, tours and regional governing bodies can decide for themselves whether to implement them or not. Regardless, suppose R&A and USGA, which organize 35 championships between themselves, put this into action, and PGA and other Tours reject them. In that case, amateurs might be playing with \u2018corrected\u2019 balls, while the Tour pros will be playing with the same balls. Steeped in rich irony, indeed. Although the proposed rules are not set to be implemented before at least 2026, let\u2019s explore the existing complications.\n\nWhat happens to the majors with the rollback policy?\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nIf they pass the rules, the R&A that organizes The Open and the USGA, the organizer of the U.S. Open, will have the limited-flight balls in these two majors. What about the others? That\u2019s for the Augusta National and PGA of America to decide.\n\nNotably, Seth Waugh, the PGA of America CEO, in a memo to R&A, denounced the proposals, taking along nine other PGAs across the globe. While Fred Ridley, the chairman of Augusta National, didn\u2019t exactly bang the drum for MLR, the former amateur golfer did stand behind the governing bodies, saying he would much prefer to see the issue finally addressed. Notably, Augusta infamously \u2018Tiger-proofed\u2019 their course to make it \u2018tougher\u2019 for golfers (read Tiger Woods).\n\nOne thing should be noted here. Although R&A and USGA both organize two LPGA majors, the Women\u2019s Open and the U.S. Women\u2019s Open, respectively, the rules will apply only to two men\u2019s golf. Why? Because the average driving distance on the LPGA Tour is still well within the accepted norm of the two regulatory bodies. We haven\u2019t heard any noise from the female circuit, even though Lexi Thompson shot a 316-yard drive at the Shrines Children\u2019s Open. But the PGA Tour Pros and LIV Golf Pros chimed in with their thoughts.\n\nWhat do players think of this?\n\nMost players are less than happy with the change. And that reaction cut across the LIV Golf-PGA Tour divide. Justin Thomas, a fifteen-time winner on the Tour who is also a part of the PGA Tour policy board, termed it \u201cselfish\u201d on the USGA\u2019s part. \u201cI think the USGA over the years has, in my eyes, it\u2019s harsh but made some pretty selfish decisions,\u201d he stated. \u201cThey definitely, in my mind, have done a lot of things that aren\u2019t for the betterment of the game, although they claim it.\u201d\n\nThe 2022 PGA Championship winner drew an interesting comparison. In the NBA, players now jump much higher than they did in the 1990s. But the hoop height has stayed the same at 10 feet above the playing surface. The two-time Major winner credits the player\u2019s grind for this.\n\nWhat Is the Model Local Rule? As the Golf Ball Rollback Debate Takes Off Once Again, All You Need To Know About the USGA?s and R&A?s Brainchild\n\nEchoing similar sentiments, Bryson DeChambeau, who joined LIV Golf in 2022, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a great handicap for us guys that have worked really hard to learn how to hit it farther.\u201d The 2020 U.S. Open Champion regularly crushes drives to 310\u2013320 yards. No wonder he termed the policy \u201catrocious.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Rory McIlroy, whose average of 326.7 yards puts him on top of the PGA Tour\u2019s driving distance leaderboard, backed this proposal for elite-level golfers. Speaking to the No Laying Up Podcast, the five-time Major winner said, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to help the overall professional game. I think making guys hit some long irons again and some mid irons and being able to hit every club in your bag in a round of golf.\u201d\n\nWhat does the Big Cat have to say about this? After all, it was Tiger Woods, whose astounding power behind the shots in the late 90s and early 2000s started the debate. Surprisingly, the fifteen-time major winner feels a course correction is necessary here. \u201cI think this should have happened a long time ago.\u201d\n\nIn fact, he said something that might not sit well with most, \u201cI\u2019ve been of the position if you play in a pro event or you have a P next to your name, you should be playing a pro ball. If you have an A next to your name and you\u2019re playing an amateur event, you should use an amateur ball.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nHow will the golf ball rollback policy affect LIV golfers?\n\nThe R&A and USGA have not made it binding on any governing bodies to implement the rules. For the breakaway league, this is the easiest path. One reason is that power hitters such as Bryson DeChambeau will be affected in more ways than one otherwise.\n\nSecondly, a league that thrives on thrills and excitement will lose its USP if the ball suddenly doesn\u2019t travel 300 yards on most occasions. As of this year, 28 of 48 LIV golfers average over 300 yards driving distance. Dustin Johnson and DeChambeau are both in the top five.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nBut one crucial thing to remember here is that the golf ball rollback policy will render most balls totally \u2018unplayable\u2019. Moreover, the PGA Tour has contradicted itself several times in the past few years. It won\u2019t be surprising if Monahan & Co. eventually decides to agree with the policy change sometime later. So, the question remains: how viable would it be for manufacturers to produce two types of balls, one for Majors and the other for LIV Golf? This just throws the world of golf into uncharted territory.\n\nWatch This Story: Is Tiger Woods Making Use Of Any Medical Aid After His Subtalar Fusion?"}, {"title": "Arteta reveals Pochettino influence on his career | Poch: He is family", "author": null, "source": "Sky Sports", "published_at": "2023-10-20T21:30:00+00:00", "category": "sports", "url": "https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12988292/chelsea-vs-arsenal-mauricio-pochettino-and-mikel-arteta-on-their-close-connection-since-psg-playing-days-ahead-of-london-derby", "body": "Mauricio Pochettino and Mikel Arteta meet as head coaches for the first time on Saturday - but the Chelsea and Arsenal bosses know each other inside out. \"He's part of my family,\" says the Argentinean.\n\nRewind to 2001 and Arteta - just a teenager - had arrived at Paris Saint-Germain on loan from Barcelona's B side.

In the aforementioned situation, the company's management estimates that despite the damage to its revenue, which cannot yet be accurately estimated, they will be reflected in the company's annual NOI and FFO within the forecast. \"In the company's assessment, the continuation of the fighting for a long time and/or a full conflict on the northern border front (or on other fronts) will result in a significant and wider damage to the economy, including deepening the damage to private consumption and businesses, including the company's tenants, and as a result will cause a decrease in payments and changes in other economic parameters.\"\n\nThe supply: Millions of square meters between Kfar Saba and Rishon Lezion\n\nEven before the war, the industry was talking about there being too large a supply of office space. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, between 2020 and 2022, construction was begun on 3.56 million square meters of office space.\n\nAvison Young Israel co-CEO Guy Amosi says, \"I am now doing four or five deals for companies that must rent space. Not large-scale deals. There are a few companies that end contracts or companies that grow and want more space. On the other hand, Midtown was written off when it was built next to Azrieli and now these are the most sought-after towers. Everything is a question of how long will it take to occupy. In the end, everything will be occupied.\"\n\nAmosi says that there are many areas in the central region, which in his opinion he fears could remain empty for a long time before they are occupied. He says, \"A company asked us to find them 15,000 square meters and asked us to map out options for offices from Rishon Lezion to Kfar Saba. They did not look in Tel Aviv where the prices are high, and two years ago contracts were closed for NIS 150 per square meter. We found that there are a huge number of projects in the area between Rosh Laz and Kfar Saba. Millions of square meters are being built and I really don't know who will occupy all these areas.\"\n\nIn his opinion, there is an advantage to offices in a good location, like Park Naimi in the central region (Messubim Junction) near Roads 4 and 1. \"It sits in a good location.\" But Amosi is bothered by offices built without an anchor tenant to begin with. \"Without a tenant for which the building is being specifically constructed for marketing. Even in Petah Tikva they are building half a million square meters of new office space.\"\n\nThere was Covid and then there was a crisis in high-tech that led to a chain reaction of reduced spending. Companies began to check every investment. Along with this, interest rates rose and inflation is rampant all over the world. We are not a bubble. Above all this, comes the war. However, in general, real estate works in waves and the wave will come again.\"\n\nThe war: \"I expected a longer stoppage\"\n\nNatalie Marshall, the owner of Marshall Strategic Real Estate marketing talks about a restored interest in offices. \"I expected there to be a longer stoppage in the office market. There was a stoppage of office marketing for a month, but about two weeks ago movement recommenced. There is also seasonality in the office sector - in July-August and during the holidays every year there is a stoppage.\n\n\"In my opinion, in an ironic way, all of us in the public have now realized that we have nowhere to go and we only have one country. In the last six months, with the protests and the reform, people did not know what to do and even thought of leaving. But we all understood that we have one home and must keep it as the best possible place. I see there has been a movement of people interested in renting offices in the last two and a half weeks and the market is alive and kicking. There are many meetings and tours of the area. At the moment we are seeing companies searching for 10,000 or 15,000 square meters.\"\n\nNewmark Natam VP real estate services Or Ben Zvi Klein explains that there are even companies interested in the southern region and there is a market for deals and factories in the region. He says, \"We managed to do such deals, such as lawyers, small high-tech companies, call centers, warehouses moving from Ofakim and Sderot towards Beer Sheva and Kiryat Gat on short contracts, so as soon as the area is restored they will return.\"\n\nBen Zvi Klein says \"In the north, I am marketing a building in Nof Hagalil. All the areas in Metula, Kiryat Shmona, etc. are not areas for offices\" says Ben Zvi Klein.\n\nRents: \"Property owners have not cut rents\"\n\nProperty developer Miki Naimi, who is building the large office park near the Messubim Interchange, does not sound bothered. He says, \"We are continuing to progress. Real estate is not for a year. I am not afraid of the situation and the war will also end. We are currently in advanced talks with three companies that will join us in Naimi Park.\n\n\"We have built 140,000 square meters out of 350,000 square meters and now we are developing another 140,000 square meters of office space with 100,000 square meters of parking lots designed by MYS architects. Our location is the most central in the country, so I am not afraid to plan and build four more buildings\".\n\nNaimi says that the first building to be occupied, with an area of 35,000 square meters, \"Is mostly marketed and there is already set to be occupancy.\" The first company to move in as early as January is Audicodes, which has leased 10,500 square meters and is implementing finishing works. \"In March-April, additional companies will enter. Sheba Medical Center Tel Hashomer will also enter there and leased 2,600 square meters and will increase to 5,300 square meters,\" he says.\n\nBen Zvi Klein thinks that as in other crises, when the crisis breaks everything halts but then we see buds of everything returning to work. But he also adds that volumes are low but no different than before the war.\n\nBen Zvi Klein says, \"\"In the first two weeks of the war, people were in the market but the market was at a standstill and once again people started to wonder, what will happen now and where are we going and how long will it take. It reminded me of the feeling during Covid, when there were ghost offices and nothing was happening. As time goes by, people come back to the offices. They really want to leave home and get to work. Most offices have emergency shelters, and relative to residential areas, most of them are protected. I live in Tel Aviv and during the fighting, when schools were closed, my children came with me to the office, because there is a shelter there and the house only has a stairwell.\n\n\"In the last three weeks, we feel that the market is returning to activity - but we entered this war when the office market was already stuttering. There were no huge deals, because there are no huge hiring in high-tech or big deals of tens of thousands of meters for the big companies. There are small and medium-sized deals. There are quite a few inquiries from high-tech and service companies looking for 1,000-2,000 square meters who want to expand. We have such inquiries in Haifa, Tel Aviv and Rehovot. There is some revival in the market, but property owners have not cut rents.\"\n\nCompanies subletting are under pressure\n\nSo if there is huge supply and a fall in demand for offices, why aren't rents falling?\n\nAmosi says, \"The prices have fallen by about 10% at most. Those cutting rents are those who bought buildings in purchase groups like BSR City where many individuals bought as a profitable investment. The construction of the building is finished and suddenly the payments such as management fees, mortgage and property taxes drop. In such cases there are people who are thinking of selling, and in these places we may see a drop in prices.\"\n\nBen Zvi Klein says that prices won't go down because people have learned lessons from the past. He says, \"Everyone was burned by Covid. A property owner who gave a discount at the beginning of Covid realized this by the end of Covid, when the office opposite the one leased out at a discount of NIS 100 per square meter was being rented out for NIS 140 per square meter. The property owners are not under pressure because they rented most of their space during the peak periods of 2021-2022. Those who are under pressure may be companies that are trying to sublet their properties and here we see attractiveness in prices for fully furnished properties.\n\n\"We have been living here for years with fighting in the background. If the war continues, people may want to break a contract. As the economy returns to work because kindergartens and schools are opening, there is a general feeling of an economy returning to normal alongside the war, and it is possible to start going to work. After Covid, there was talk about what would happen and whether people would return to work and in the end everyone returned to work from the office. I am optimistic about the office market in the future.\"\n\nPublished by Globes, Israel business news - en.globes.co.il - on December 3, 2023.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2023."}, {"title": "Potential Conor McGregor Fight Could Help Canelo Alvarez Come a Step Closer to Surpass Floyd Mayweather\u2019s Net Worth and His Billionaire Status", "author": "Sudeep Sinha", "source": "Essentially Sports", "published_at": "2023-10-18T21:27:46+00:00", "category": "sports", "url": "https://www.essentiallysports.com/boxing-news-perspective-potential-conor-mcgregor-fight-could-help-canelo-alvarez-come-a-step-closer-to-surpass-floyd-mayweathers-net-worth-and-his-billionaire-status/", "body": "Crossover boxing matches are all the rage these days. Until a few days ago, the phenomenon was limited to influencers and MMA stars. But after a recent quarrel on X (formerly Twitter) between Conor McGregor and Canelo Alvarez, a potential crossover boxing match has the boxing world buzzing with excitement. If the fight were to turn into a reality, it could help \u2018Cinnamon\u2019 get closer to his former rival Floyd Mayweather in terms of net worth.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\n\nThe talks of Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather began with a tweet that launched a fiery exchange of words between these two mammoths of combat sports. The brash and confident \u2018Notorious\u2019 McGregor turned to X, praising Mayweather\u2019s 2013 performance against Canelo. But he also boasted about landing more punches on \u2018Money\u2019 Mayweather than the Mexican superstar. Canelo quickly retorted, asserting he would need only one hand to make quick work of McGregor. Later, the banter further escalated, bringing a potential fight in the picture.\n\nCanelo Alvarez\u2019s earnings and Floyd Mayweather\u2019s influence\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nCanelo Alvarez reached his career high by becoming the first boxer to become the undisputed champion at super-middleweight by holding onto the WBA Super, WBC, and Ring Magazine super middleweight titles since 2020, and the IBF nd WBO titles since 2021. Meanwhile, his pockets became deeper and deeper, to the point that Canelo boasts a $180 million net worth in 2023. The most significant addition to his bank balance came when he signed a lucrative $365 million deal with DAZN and Golden Boy Promotions.\n\nvia Imago RECORD DATE NOT STATED Saul -Canelo- Alvarez MEX vs Jermell Charlo USA \u2013 Weigh-in ceremony Saul -Canelo- Alvarez MEX during the weigh-in ceremony prior to the Boxing fight against Jermell Charlo USA, at the T-Mobile Arena Explanade on September 29, 2023. brbr Saul -Canelo- Alvarez MEX durante la ceremonia de pesaje previo a la pelea de Box contra Jermell Charlo USA, en la Explanada del Arena T-Mobile el 29 de septiembre de 2023.

When Mayweather defeated Canelo, it pushed him to hone his skills while starting a lifelong rivalry. On the other hand, McGregor made his boxing debut against Mayweather, losing the fight but leaving with a fat stack.\n\nImplications of a fight between Canelo Alvarez and Conor McGregor\n\nThe excitement and allure of two mammoths of combat sports getting in the ring to pummel each other to the brink of their endurance is undeniable. Not to mention, the fight will leave either party significantly wealthier than before. A potential clash between Saul Canelo Alvarez and the \u2018Notorious\u2019 Conor McGregor would not just be a dream come true for fans everywhere. It would also be a money magnet that would funnel income from a variety of channels.\n\nA few of those lucrative channels of income would be revenue from pay-per-view sales, live gate revenue, merchandise sales from either party and various promotional events from the fight. What\u2019s more, if anyone wondered if people would want to watch the fight. The attention it has gathered in the small span of their X (Twitter) feud should be evidence enough. Not to mention, both fighters command a massive fan base, counted in millions across the globe.\n\nCanelo Alvarez and McGregor\u2019s history of massive purses\n\nIf Canelo\u2019s PPV pull was ever in question, his history of fight purses should convince everyone. Stepping back in time, Canelo\u2019s fight with Mayweather collected 2.2 million pay-per-view buys. His 2017 bout against Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr. collected 1 million PPV buys. Canelo\u2019s first battle with Gennady Golovkin gathered 1.3 million PPV sales. In his most recent battle against Jermell Charlo, the fight collected 700K PPV sales. These were just to name a few; over the years, Canelo has fought in increasingly profitable bouts.\n\nOn the other hand, Conor McGregor has created his own history in MMA as well as boxing. First of all, McGregor\u2019s fight against Mayweather generated 4.3 million pay-per-view buys. His second fight against Dustin Poirier collected 1.6 million buys. The infamous fight against Khabib Nurmagomedov saw 2.4 million PPV sales. And lastly, his second fight against Nate Diaz collected 1.65 million PPV buys. If these numbers are any evidence, a Canelo vs. McGregor clash would break all their previous records by a mile.\n\nA substantial step toward Mayweather\u2019s net worth/Billionaire status\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Floyd Mayweather is the richest boxer in the world. The legendary undefeated boxer boasts a staggering net worth of $450 million. It makes the retired boxer the richest personality in boxing to ever exist. Despite retiring from the sport, he occasionally fights in exhibition matches, generating millions each time. In addition, Floyd has made over a billion dollars in the span of his career.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nvia Getty LAS VEGAS, NEVADA \u2013 JUNE 29: Floyd Mayweather Jr. attends a game between the New York Liberty and the Las Vegas Aces at Michelob ULTRA Arena on June 29, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

If Canelo vs. McGregor ever manages to materialize, it could help Canelo take a significant leap to Mayweather\u2019s net worth. The financial windfall from such a humongous clash would be substantial, driving him closer to Mayweather\u2019s level of wealth. If Canelo\u2019s past earnings are any evidence, this fight will be bigger than ever before. Canelo\u2019s biggest fight to date is $45 million from the third encounter with Golovkin. So, a fight with McGregor could earn him anywhere from $55 to $60 million, adding to his $180 million. Meaning his total net worth would jump up to $240 million.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nWhile matching Floyd\u2019s net worth is no easy feat, if anyone can do it \u2013 it\u2019s Canelo Alvarez. However, only time will tell if the fight can ever materialize. In case it does, it will be a spectacle the whole world would come together to witness. Do you think McGregor vs. Canelo can happen?

At the moment, Danis is preparing hard for his Misfits contest, as he\u2019s tried to get in the head of his opponent leading up to the bout. As a result, Danis has garnered over a million followers on X. \u2018El Jefe\u2019 has been trying to dig up the past relationships of Logan Paul\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Nina Agdal, as a way to create turmoil in Paul\u2019s mindset during the fight.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\n\nHowever, this beef was first started by Logan Paul\u2019s younger brother, Jake Paul. He called out Danis on his Instagram story in 2020, by taking a hit at his rumored ex-girlfriend, Savannah Montano. So Danis\u2019s target at Agdal could have a revenge angle that many didn\u2019t know about. Even Logan addressed the topic of Montano and Jake during their first press conference. So, who is this girl? What\u2019s the actual story here?\n\nWho is Dillon Danis\u2019 ex-girlfriend often linked with Jake Paul?\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nSavannah Montano was quite a trending name back in 2020, and that was mostly because of her relationship with the Bellator MMA fighter, Dillon Danis. Montano is a successful Instagram model, with around 1.6 million followers on her social media. The couple turned a lot of heads during their relationship, sharing some NSFW steamy pictures and videos for their fans.\n\nDespite their controversial relationship, Montano also gained some attention after Jake Paul used her to call out Dillon Danis for a fight. After knocking out the ex-NBA star, Nate Robinson, \u2018The Problem Child\u2019, was on the hunt to find his next opponent. At the time, the name that popped up the most was 2-0 Dillon Danis. So, when he shared the screenshot of the FaceTime with Danis\u2019s ex-girlfriend, the fans started drawing connections.\n\nPaul somehow found the model\u2019s number and sent her a FaceTime request. Many started to believe that Montano was having an affair and cheating on her then-boyfriend Danis. Paul posted two stories. In the first one, he wrote, \u201cAye [Dillon Danis], come get your girl back.\u201d And then in the second one, he took another hit at the fighter by writing, \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you soon.\u201d So this begs the question, is it true? Was Paul actually involved in an affair with Savannah Montano?\n\nDid Jake Paul and Savannah Montano hook up?\n\nThis callout didn\u2019t help much, as Jake Paul never could finalize his fight with Dillon Danis. Instead, he ended up taking the fight against the former Olympic MMA artist, Ben Askren in 2021. He again won the fight by a knockout, while many fans still thought that Danis was smart to not respond to the Youtuber-turned-boxer. Still, Paul tried his best to involve Montano in their non-existent tussle.\n\nvia Getty TAMPA, FLORIDA \u2013 DECEMBER 18: Jake Paul fights Tyron Woddley during a rematch of an eight-round cruiserweight bout at the Amalie Arena on December 18, 2021 in Tampa, Florida.

He said, \u201cDillon, I know you\u2019re watching this \u2026 Just remember you\u2019re still a bitch and I hooked up with your girlfriend. Savannah, how you doing? What\u2019s good?\u201d However, Montano completely denied any relation with the Influencer boxer whatsoever. She responded to Paul\u2019s stories through a video and gave her side of the story.\n\nShe said, \u201cI\u2019m dead confused at some of you guys going, \u2018Oh, but why did you answer his call?\u2019 As if I have his f**king number saved in my phone! It was literally a random number. You can literally see in the video, I\u2019m like, \u2018Who is this?\u2019\u201d So she denied the accusations of hooking up with Paul and even felt disgusted by the speculations.\n\nHowever, her current relationship status is unknown. Even three years later, many followers are still not convinced about her breakup with Dillon Danis.\n\nDillon Danis and Savannah Montano breakup reality\n\nAs of now, it\u2019s not completely clear whether the couple is still together or not. They haven\u2019t made any claims of breakup and have been silent about their relationship with each other. The only things that have changed are Savannah\u2019s Instagram feed. She has stopped posting pictures with Danis, which were quite prevalent back in 2020. Also, another thing that hints towards their breakup is Danis\u2019s first press conference for the Logan Paul fight.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nDuring the fight, Logan Paul brought up the topic of Montano, when Danis pointedly mentioned their breakup. Paul said, \u201cYo you\u2019ve been so salty ever since Savannah rejected your a** to go hook up with real athletes. You don\u2019t gotta take that s**t out on me because my brother hooked up with your ex.\u201d Danis scoffed at Maverick\u2019s claim and clapped back, \u201cAt least I got rid of the sl*t, you\u2019re marrying one.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nSo, this tells the fans that Danis is no longer together with Montano. Anyway, the fans could look out for her attendance at Danis\u2019s first-ever boxing debut on October 14 at the AO Arena, Manchester. Although there were rumors about Danis pulling out, it seems the fight is still going to take place. So, her presence at Danis\u2019s ringside may make things even more complicated. What are your thoughts about this? Are they still together?

Unfortunately, that\u2019s led to the first casualty among Twitter alternatives, as the startup Pebble (formerly T2), is shutting down. The would-be X rival had grown a small but engaged community on its microblogging service that aimed to dupe Twitter\u2019s features, from its verification systems to functionality like DMs. But the company says they\u2019ve run out of time to make Pebble happen \u2014 the app maxed out at 3,000 daily active users, out of 20,000 registered users. That daily user figure fell to 1,000 daily users following its rebranding from T2.\n\nIn part, the sizable competition coming from other Twitter rivals was to blame, says co-founder and CEO Gabor Cselle, who had exits to Google and Twitter prior to starting Pebble.\n\n\u201cI think the competitive landscape evolved faster than we had thought,\u201d he explains. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that quite as many people \u2014 established organizations and newcomers \u2014 would try to do the same thing that we were doing and in very similar ways.\u201d\n\nToday, the market for Twitter alternatives is a crowded one, to say the least. There are numerous services for consumers to try, including the open source-based platform Mastodon, a soon-to-be decentralized system from Bluesky, plus smaller startups like Spill, Spoutible and Post, as well as a new app from Meta called Instagram Threads.\n\nThen, of course, there\u2019s the X factor to consider. The default platform for short posts retains some pull, despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 new owner Elon Musk\u2019s antics. Though the company may not have yet succeeded from a business and financial perspective, it\u2019s been hard for others to duplicate its function as a breaking news platform and place for spirited debates.\n\n\u201cI think Threads and others have encountered this as well,\u201d adds Pebble co-founder and CTO Michael Greer, previously Discord engineering head. \u201cThe durability of the network effect of Twitter is stronger than anticipated,\u201d he says.\n\nDespite these challenges, Pebble initially had decent retention. By week four, it was seeing retention rates of 30%, in fact. Its invite list was also working, as 60% of people who received a Pebble invite converted to become users. In addition, some 10,000 users arrived at that list from early press, like TechCrunch\u2019s coverage of its first outside funding \u2014 a $1.1 million angel round that included investors like former Google VP Bradley Horowitz, Android co-founder Rich Miner and the former CEO of Wikipedia, Katherine Maher. Data from Similarweb indicates the Pebble website topped 99,300 visits last month, indicating repeat usage.\n\nThe company\u2019s hypothesis was that consumers were hungry for a Twitter alternative that prioritized trust, safety and moderation from the start. To that end, Pebble\u2019s founding team included co-founder Sarah Oh, Twitter\u2019s former human rights advisor.\n\nPebble continues to believe its approach to moderation was correct, even if it was not ultimately a factor in driving growth.\n\n\u201cWe came in with a particular angle: kinder, safer. Trust and safety. And I think our approach to moderation that we did have on the site did work,\u201d says Cselle, adding that Pebble didn\u2019t have some of the issues other federated platforms faced. For example, TechCrunch reported that Bluesky earlier this year had strained its relationship with Black users, as it failed to crack down on bigotry on the site. Later, users on Bluesky were even creating usernames with racial slurs, and yet the platform didn\u2019t issue a public apology. Pebble never faced any such controversies.\n\nBut it may have positioned itself a little too far into the \u201ckindness\u201d territory, the founders now believe.\n\n\u201cWe were really seized by people saying they wanted something that felt safer, where they could speak openly without dogpiling,\u201d says Oh. \u201cAnd so we were confident that was an important thing to hit. Are there other things that are equally important and a great user experience? Yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter is you have real people\u2026saying real things,\u201d Oh continues. \u201cAt the expense of using a word that\u2019s overused, \u2018authentic.\u2019 And our theory was always if you can create a space where people really feel like they can let down their hair, then you would get that authentic content. We didn\u2019t quite get there,\u201d she admits.\n\nCselle agrees, noting that, perhaps, Pebble should have opened up enough space for disagreement to happen, while still drawing a hard line on the most disagreeable parts of running a Twitter-like platform.\n\n\u201cI think we could have maybe moved a little bit further towards that,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nice things that are said on Pebble, but maybe not enough breaking news. Not enough conversation.\u201d\n\nThere were other things that may have hurt Pebble\u2019s traction, too, including its lack of a native mobile app. As T2, the startup prioritized building for the web to be agile and more flexible, but lost out on the opportunities for discovery driven by the app stores. Notes Greer, \u201cthat might have been a mistake.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, Cselle also questions if the rebranding from T2 to Pebble may have been an issue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wondering if the Pebble rebrand had actually softened the value prop[position] because T2 just encapsulated it so much \u2014 that it was really duplicative [of Twitter],\u201d he says.\n\nLike most startup shutdowns, the answer as to \u201cwhy\u201d is not any one thing but a combination of factors. For Pebble, that\u2019s certainly true. It was a perfect storm of competition, X\u2019s continued traction, the lack of a native app, a brand that didn\u2019t resonate and a space that was maybe a little too safe to be as addictive and as fun as the original.\n\nWith Pebble\u2019s winddown, being announced to users today at 9 AM PT, early adopters will have the option of exporting their Pebble archive as a zip file that loads a mini web page showcasing all their old posts.

On the other, this has been an incredibly long time coming.\n\nGO DEEPER What is Haaland really like?\n\nOf the 213 FIFA-affiliated nations, Norway\u2019s is the longest-standing outright individual goalscoring record in the world. It was set by Jorgen Juve, a fascinating figure who ended his international career in 1937 and later became a renowned sports journalist in his home country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuve scored a relatively modest 33 goals in 45 matches for Norway, including five hat-tricks, although his tally is made remarkable by the fact he played as a centre-forward in less than half of those games. He was otherwise positioned in defence, from where he captained his nation to the bronze medal at the 1936 Olympics. That explains why his final international goal came three years before his final cap, in June 1934. Therefore, it is likely that by the time Haaland scores six more goals, it will be around 90 years since Juve reached the 33-goal mark.\n\nThere is technically one other record that stands for longer, also in Scandinavia.\n\nPoul \u201cTist\u201d Nielsen scored 52 goals in 38 games for Denmark between 1910 and 1925, although his record was equalled by Jon Dahl Tomasson \u2014 now manager of Blackburn Rovers in the English Championship \u2014 in 2010. Tomasson elected to retire from international football after that year\u2019s World Cup in South Africa rather than seeking to make the record his own. Nielsen\u2019s name therefore remains in the record books, although he now holds Denmark\u2019s record only jointly.\n\nThis graph demonstrates the extent to which these records are outliers.\n\nOnly six countries\u2019 goalscoring records have stood for more than 50 years, including Libya, Sudan and Guinea. Therefore, if we only include nations to have qualified for the World Cup, it is only Denmark, Norway and Hungary whose records have lasted more than half a century.\n\nHungary\u2019s record is perhaps the most impressive, considering Ferenc Puskas scored 84 goals in just 85 games, and his international career was brought to a premature end at the age of 29 because of the Hungarian Revolution. He later represented Spain at the 1962 World Cup, having gone half a decade without playing international football.\n\nFerenc Puskas (right) playing for Hungary against England at Wembley in 1953 (Barratts/PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nThe most striking thing about the graph is how many goalscoring records have been set recently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSixty-four of the 211 nations\u2019 record goalscorers have appeared for them in 2023, and in terms of time since they were set, the median goalscoring mark has stood for just seven years, which includes the likes of the Republic of Ireland\u2019s Robbie Keane and Paraguay\u2019s Roque Santa Cruz. Increased longevity due to superior fitness levels in the modern game is clearly a major factor, as is the number of relatively new nations on the FIFA list.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising international goalscoring record is that of Italy.\n\nGiga Riva\u2019s relatively insubstantial haul of 35 goals has been the mark to beat since World Cup 1974. Not only has it not been matched or eclipsed, but no one has ever got particularly near it \u2014 Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del Piero both reached 27 and that\u2019s as close as anyone has come.\n\nFor context, four Englishmen have reached 35 goals in that period \u2014 Gary Lineker, Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane. Four Spaniards too \u2014 Raul Gonzalez, Fernando Torres, David Villa and David Silva, while Alvaro Morata (on 34) should get there shortly.\n\nFurthermore, no current Italians seem set to challenge it \u2014 Ciro Immobile (with 17) has less than half that tally, turns 34 years old in February, and has been omitted from recent squads. Nobody in Luciano Spalletti\u2019s current squad has scored more than eight international goals.\n\nItaly\u2019s shortcoming clearly isn\u2019t about a complete lack of prolific strikers \u2014 the likes of Christian Vieri, Pippo Inzaghi and Luca Toni all scored heavily at club level. Sometimes it\u2019s been the opposite, with various strikers competing for a starting place, meaning none of them got to dominate the national side for a decade. That said, around a decade ago, there was simply a dearth of prolific Italian strikers to choose from. Antonio Conte used Eder and Graziano Pelle up front at the 2016 European Championship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also tactical considerations. Not only have Italy traditionally been the most defensive of the major European nations, but their attacking play has generally been based around using a second striker. Baggio, Del Piero and Francesco Totti have all been the golden boy at various \u2014 overlapping \u2014 stages, with Italy\u2019s No 9 often selected primarily to bring the best out of Italy\u2019s No 10.\n\nWhat of Norway? They, similarly, were traditionally a defensive-minded side, favouring counter-attacks and long balls. At their peak under Egil Olsen in the mid-1990s, they often used a striker out of position on the wing, where he would challenge for long, diagonal balls.\n\nNorway\u2019s Jostein Flo, a giant striker often utilised on the right flank, at the 1994 World Cup (Chris Cole/Allsport)\n\nBut perhaps the more pertinent thing about Norway is that, historically, they generally haven\u2019t been very competitive.\n\nThey\u2019ve only ever qualified for four major tournaments \u2014 in 1938, 1994, 1998 and 2000 \u2014 and have won a combined three matches in those appearances. They\u2019re also similar to Italy in that, at times, they\u2019ve boasted various high-level strikers whose careers roughly overlapped \u2014 John Carew, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Tore Andre Flo, Steffen Iversen \u2014 and at other points have suffered a complete lack of good centre-forwards.\n\nAt this point in time, Norway appear to have the most prolific striker in Europe, and it\u2019s not unreasonable to consider where Haaland might end up in the all-time international goalscoring charts worldwide, never mind just in relation to his compatriots.\n\nHaaland is currently averaging nearly a goal a game for his country, which will inevitably be difficult for the 23-year-old to sustain over his career. But it\u2019s worth pointing out how impressive that is, even at this early stage. Again, excluding countries who have never qualified for a World Cup, only the aforementioned quartet of Juve, Riva, Puskas and Nielsen, plus Japan\u2019s Kunishige Kamamoto, hold their nation\u2019s international goalscoring records and also boast a rate of 0.75 goals per game or more.\n\nEven Cristiano Ronaldo, the most prolific international goalscorer of all time with 127 for Portugal, boasts \u2018only\u2019 0.63 goals per game, a lower rate than the likes of Romelu Lukaku (Belgium), Kane and Aleksandar Mitrovic (Serbia), which owes to his early days as a winger rather than a central striker.\n\nKane and Ronaldo, two national-team record scorers still operating in 2023 (Burak Akbulut/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nConsidering how many hat-tricks Haaland scores for Manchester City, it\u2019s not beyond the realms of possibility that he could score six goals during this international break to move level with Juve, particularly given Norway\u2019s first fixture is a home friendly against the Faroe Islands today (Thursday), before a European Championship qualifier against Scotland in Glasgow on Sunday. That said, the Faroes\u2019 defence is less leaky than you might expect \u2014 only twice in their last 22 outings have they conceded more than three times in a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe wider question is whether we will ever see Haaland at a major tournament.\n\nDespite the presence of him and Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard, Norway have failed to qualify from their Euro 2024 qualification group directly, with Spain and Scotland already securing the top two spots.\n\nThey are, at least, likely to qualify for the play-offs, and therefore will have two must-win games in March to secure their first major tournament appearance since 2000 \u2014 the summer when Haaland was born. But there\u2019s been little in recent performances to think Norway will breeze through those play-offs.\n\nJuve\u2019s individual record will soon be surpassed, but captaining his side to a bronze medal at the Olympics may stand as his nation\u2019s greatest achievement for much longer.\n\nGO DEEPER Erling Haaland is phenomenal - so why hasn\u2019t he made Manchester City better?\n\n(Top photo: Sebastian Widmann \u2013 UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)"}, {"title": "The new, \u2018efficient\u2019 Spotify has a very different approach to podcasting", "author": "Ariel Shapiro", "source": "The Verge", "published_at": "2023-10-25T16:10:29+00:00", "category": "technology", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/25/23931833/spotify-efficient-daniel-ek-rogan-cooper-ai", "body": "This is Hot Pod, The Verge\u2019s newsletter about podcasting and the audio industry. Sign up here for more.\n\nIn pursuit of profit, Spotify looks to AI rather than original content for its podcasting future\n\nSpotify shareholders are thrilled with the company reporting an operating profit for the first time in a year, sending the stock up nearly 10 percent on the news. The revenue bump was in large part due to the streamer\u2019s $1 price increase earlier this year, but executives also pointed to the downsizing of the podcast operation \u2014 which included hundreds of layoffs and the dissolution of Gimlet and Parcast \u2014 as a contributing factor. The adage that \u201ccontent is king\u201d no longer applies, with Spotify increasingly focusing on tools that will scale the business rather than content that will attract listeners.\n\nIn a call with investors, CFO Paul Vogel said that after being a real \u201cdrag\u201d on profit margins in the past, podcasting will soon break even and turn toward profitability. CEO Daniel Ek echoed that sentiment. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly finding new ways to bring more efficiencies out of the business\u2026 We\u2019ve seen some improvements, but you should expect us to continue to look for more improvements going forward because that\u2019s just our modus operandi.\u201d\n\nWhile Ek and Vogel really hammered that \u201cefficiency\u201d theme (according to my transcript, they said the word more than 30 times over the course of the 50-minute call), what was left unsaid about podcasting spoke louder. In the past, they would excitedly tout how many millions of podcasts were on the platform, the latest new celebrity show, and the area\u2019s explosive growth. But as investors have run out of patience for the time and money such ambitions required, the company\u2019s leadership changed its tune.\n\nRather than emphasizing, say, its new revenue sharing deal with Trevor Noah or the reliability of The Ringer, Ek pointed to Spotify\u2019s new AI-driven translation product. He pointed to the automatic translation tool as a way of seamlessly scaling podcasts and increasing the amount of content in non-English speaking markets. He also expects AI will be a boon for podcast advertising, as well.\n\n\u201cCreating a great audio ad is something that\u2019s quite costly and quite expensive for marketers to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat generative AI has the promise to do is allow for that creative cost to come down\u2026 It [also] allows you to scale that creative in unimaginable ways. You can translate whatever creative you had into lots of different languages; you can use the same voice actor; but instead of producing one or two ads, you can have 1,000 or 10,000 or even 100,000 ads that are individually created to each user.\u201d\n\nI would take that with a grain of salt (we know Ek loves to dream big!!), but it does underscore the newest iteration of Spotify\u2019s podcasting business \u2014 leaner, less splash, and more scale. It doesn\u2019t mean that Spotify\u2019s contributions to podcasting will be insignificant \u2014 as one audio industry professional said to me, the translation thing could be a total game-changer for the medium (if it\u2019s not a complete dud). But we should not expect those contributions to come in the form of original content.\n\nThe main question I am left with after these results is where Spotify\u2019s licensing deals fit in. I wish during the call that someone had asked Ek about the plan for big-name talent like Joe Rogan, Alex Cooper, and Dax Shepard as their deals come up for renewal. On one hand, they have the scale (Rogan especially). On the other, they cost a chunk of cash (... Rogan especially). I will have more on this later this week, but it will be interesting to see how much Spotify and its investors can stomach spending on the biggest names in podcasting.\n\nWondery puts its podcasts on TV\n\nThat\u2019s certainly one way to get podcasts to the masses. Wondery, which is owned by Amazon, will make many of its podcasts available on three new channels on Freevee, an ad-supported video streaming service also owned by Amazon that was formerly known as IMDb TV (yes, Amazon owns IMDb, too).\n\nOn October 31st, Freevee will launch three dedicated Wondery channels: a flagship channel focused on entertainment programming like Baby, This is Keke Palmer, Business Wars, and American Scandal; Exhibit C, which will feature true crime shows like This is Actually Happening, Dr. Death, and Morbid; Wondery; and Wondery Sports, with shows including Don\u2019t Call It a Comeback and Gladiator. The visuals will be a mix of on-camera recordings, animations, and show art \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t bank on that being the main draw.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting strategy for discovery, though I am not sure how replicable it is beyond Amazon. If it is successful, I could see a situation where other AVODs license podcast programming (it\u2019s certainly cheaper than video), but Amazon is in the unique situation where it owns the whole pipeline, so there is not much risk here.\n\nJoe Rogan Experience is the most-searched podcast, followed by Call Her Daddy and This American Life\n\nPodBam released a list of the 40 most-searched podcasts, and it is no surprise that Rogan is number one. The Joe Rogan Experience averaged 135,000 monthly searches on Google, followed by Call Her Daddy with 106,000 and This American Life with 81,000."}, {"title": "New ultrathin materials can pull climate-warming CO2 from the air", "author": "Shi En Kim", "source": "Science News For Students", "published_at": "2023-12-15T11:30:00+00:00", "category": "science", "url": "https://www.snexplores.org/article/nanomaterial-mxene-carbon-capture-air", "body": "This is another in our series of stories identifying new technologies and actions that can slow climate change, reduce its impacts or help communities cope with a rapidly changing world.\n\nOne up-and-coming class of tiny materials could help solve the huge problem of climate change. How? By catching climate-warming carbon dioxide out of the air.\n\nThe nano-scale materials are called MXenes (MAX-eenz). Their name comes from their structure, which is made up of alternating layers of M and X atoms. \u201cM\u201d layers consist of some transition metal. (Those atoms are bulky and can shed a variable number of electrons.) \u201cX\u201d layers contain atoms of another element, such as carbon or nitrogen.\n\nA single MXene sheet contains a few of these alternating M and X layers chemically bound to each other. It may look like MXM or MXMXM. Each sheet is typically only about 1 nanometer thick. For comparison, a sheet of paper is 100,000 times thicker.\n\nMXenes normally come as stacks of these individual sheets. The many separate sheets inside a stack add up to a huge overall surface area. It\u2019s like how the combined surface area of all the pages in a book is much larger than that of just the covers.\n\nIn fact, the total surface area contained in one gram (1/400 ounce) of MXene \u201ccan cover a football field,\u201d notes Per Persson. He\u2019s a materials scientist at Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden.\n\nAtoms across MXenes\u2019 large surface areas can interact with their environment. That includes grabbing carbon dioxide, or CO 2, out of the air around them \u2014 a process called carbon capture.\n\nThe white exhaust leaving smokestacks at this coal-fired power plant in Arizona is largely steam. Not visible is the carbon dioxide gas also leaving those stacks. MXene nanomaterials could be installed at or near the top of each stack to collect much of that climate-warming CO 2 before it escapes into the open air. Miguel Sotomayor/Moment/Getty Images Plus\n\nMXenes are excellent at snagging CO 2 , Persson says. Some researchers think it\u2019s because CO 2 molecules are just the right size to fit between a MXene\u2019s tight layers. Persson suspects it\u2019s because CO 2 and MXenes like to share electrons, allowing CO 2 to chemically stick to a MXene\u2019s surface.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, MXenes chemically ignore other common gases \u2014 such as nitrogen, the most abundant gas in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This could allow MXenes to suck climate-warming CO 2 out of the air while leaving the rest of the atmosphere alone.\n\nSeveral research groups have been exploring MXenes\u2019 potential to capture CO 2 from the air. In the Link\u00f6ping experiments, \u201cCO 2 stuck to the MXene surface like refrigerator magnets,\u201d Persson says. \u201cIt was absolutely amazing.\u201d His group has shown that MXenes can sponge up as much as half their weight in CO 2 .\n\nOne large family\n\nMXenes don\u2019t exist in nature. Scientists have to make them.\n\nThis is freshly produced MXene, which normally forms a dark powder when dry. This MXene contains alternating layers of vanadium (M) and carbon (X) atoms. Karamullah Eisawi/Tulane Univ.\n\nThey do this using other labmade compounds called MAX phases. Like MXenes, MAX phases are layered crystals. But MAX phases have extra sheets of metal \u201cA\u201d that sandwich between their M and X layers.\n\nTo turn MAX phases into MXenes, scientists must eat away the A layers using a strong acid. A common one is hydrofluoric (Hy-droh-FLOOR-ik) acid. (This acid is so harsh that it can dissolve the minerals in your bones!) The treatment leaves behind just the M and X layers.\n\nSince the materials\u2019 discovery, scientists have found safer ways to make MXenes. These techniques use milder acids or bases. One such chemical is sodium hydroxide. That\u2019s an ingredient in soap. Another recent method is to use molten fluoride salts to etch away the A layer in MAX phases. No harsh compounds are needed there, although it does take high temps \u2014 up to 750\u00b0 Celsius (1,380\u00b0 Fahrenheit).\n\nMXenes are the largest group of flat, sheetlike nanomaterials. Scientists refer to them as being largely two-dimensional, or 2-D. Another famous example of a 2-D material is graphene.\n\nThis diagram depicts a process to convert MAX phase materials into thin sheets of MXenes. An acid etches out all but the M layers (blue) and X layers (purple) to yield thick MXene sheets. The far right panel shows a scanning electron microscope image of the MXene. M. Ozkan et al/Chem. Oct. 4, 2023 ( CC BY 4.0 DEED\n\nMXenes have \u201cprobably the largest diversity and tunability any 2-D material can offer,\u201d says Michael Naguib. By tunable, this engineering physicist means that MXenes can be tweaked to take on different properties. Naguib works at Tulane University in New Orleans, La. He made the world\u2019s first MXene in 2011, a titanium carbide.\n\nScientists have now made more than 50 MXenes. New ones arise when scientists mix and match different M and X atoms. Each MXene has slightly different properties, from how well it conducts electricity to how strong it is.\n\nScientists can even modify existing MXenes by treating them with different chemicals. This involves covering the MXene\u2019s surface with new atoms, such as oxygen and fluorine, to change its behavior. For more than a decade, scientists have been tailoring different MXenes for use in batteries and other energy storage devices. But tweaking MXenes\u2019 chemistry can also alter their ability to collect CO 2 .\n\nIn an October 4 paper in Chem, engineers at the University of California, Riverside, reviewed the potential widespread use of MXenes. In a statement, lead author Mihri Ozkan noted, \u201cTheir unique properties make them excellent candidates for capturing CO 2 .\u201d\n\nPainting on a CO 2 -absorber\n\nFreshly prepared MXenes appear as a dark-colored powder. Each fleck contains many MXene sheets. Under a microscope, they look like loose sheets of paper. MXenes become easier to work with when scientists add this powder to water, creating an ink, says Anupma Thakur. She\u2019s a materials scientist that Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.\n\nMihri Ozkan, an engineer at the University of California, Riverside, is the lead author of the new study showing that certain MXenes can act like carbon-dioxide sponges. These nano-scale sheets can sop up that climate-warming gas from the air. UC Riverside\n\nAs ink, Thakur adds, scientists can simply paint MXenes onto desired surfaces, such as fabric, plastic or glass. Or, if a thick enough coat of MXene paint is peeled carefully off a surface, it can even become a free-standing sheet.\n\nWhen toughened with polymers, MXene films can durably separate CO 2 from exhaust gas. For carbon capture, Persson imagines fitting MXene filters atop chimneys where the exhaust from burned materials is rich in CO 2 .\n\nTo absorb CO 2 from the air elsewhere, Thakur suggests putting stacks of MXene screens out in the open. This method would be less efficient at capturing CO 2 , though, since average levels of CO 2 in the air far from pollution sources are quite low.\n\nKeep in mind, trapping CO 2 anywhere is just a first step in managing this pollutant, says Vitalie Stavila. He\u2019s a materials chemist at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, Calif. \u201cThe problem is, what are you going to do with all that CO 2 ?\u201d he says. Scientists will have to figure out how to retrieve the trapped gas from the MXenes after they\u2019re full.\n\nMXenes could be heated up to release their CO 2 for long-term storage somewhere else. Flushing MXenes with a different kind of gas, such as hydrogen, might also remove the CO 2 from them. Then the MXenes could be reused for a new round of carbon capture.\n\nMXenes could also help transform the CO 2 they capture into other useful compounds, Stavila says. That\u2019s because MXenes are catalytic. That means they can help drive other chemicals, such as CO 2 , to react. MXenes also conduct electricity. Since they like sharing electrons with CO 2 , they can ferry those electrons to other compounds.\n\nAs a result, \u201cyou can do [transformations of CO 2 ] that may not be otherwise possible,\u201d Stavila says. For instance, with a boost from MXenes, CO 2 can react with hydrogen to form methanol or formic acid. These liquids can be used as fuels to reduce people\u2019s reliance on newly mined fossil fuels, which add new CO 2 to the atmosphere. Or, better yet, these liquids can be stored somewhere to keep their carbon out of the air for good.\n\nThis diagram (cropped for clarity) shows how a dry MXene (upper left) or wet one (lower left) appear to capture and store carbon dioxide molecules (trio of black and red atoms) within its structure (in right version of each MXene). M. Ozkan et al/Chem. Oct. 4, 2023 ( CC BY 4.0 DEED\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nSince they\u2019re still fairly new, MXenes today are only used in research. Scientists have to iron out some kinks before these will be ready for use in the real world. And that will take several years, at least.\n\nOne weakness of MXenes is that they can break down and transform into other solids called oxides in the presence of oxygen. So water and oxygen make MXenes less reactive. But scientists think they can overcome this problem by tweaking MXenes\u2019 structure. Capping the materials\u2019 edges with bulky salts, for instance, could shield MXenes from damage by oxygen.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard, right now, to make large amounts of MXenes. In the lab, researchers can make only several kilograms (pounds) in a single batch. Several companies are working out how to boost batch sizes.\n\nBut Thakur points out one irony: Making MXenes for carbon capture can have a big carbon footprint. It takes a lot of electricity to get the heat needed to make them, she notes. Much of that electricity is made using CO 2 -spewing fossil fuels. It\u2019s important to make sure that the energy used to make these materials doesn\u2019t spew more CO 2 than the MXenes can later sop up. Otherwise, that would defeat their use in carbon capture.\n\nEducators and Parents, Sign Up for The Cheat Sheet Weekly updates to help you use Science News Explores in the learning environment Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nMXenes also cost a lot to make. The high cost of making these materials would be less important if they could withstand thousands of CO 2 capture-and-release cycles. That way, scientists wouldn\u2019t have to keep making new MXenes.\n\nSo far, no one has tested MXenes\u2019 durability for stored CO 2 removal and reuse. Still, it helps that MXenes are mechanically rugged. Research has shown that certain types can be as strong as steel.\n\nThe Riverside group\u2019s new paper also points to a related family of nanosheets that may prove good CO 2 sponges. Made from MXenes, they\u2019re known as MBenes, because the \u201cX\u201d layer is made up of boron atoms. These materials are harder to make than MXenes. So most research on them has been done with math or computer models. But MBenes could have unique mechanical and electrical traits, Ozkan\u2019s team finds. And those just might help them last through many, many cycles of CO 2 capture and release.\n\nEach year, human activities spew tens of billions of tons of CO 2 into the air. That\u2019s equivalent to the weight of tens of billions of elephants. Carbon absorbers, including MXenes or MBenes, can\u2019t catch it all. As such, they\u2019re never going to replace the need for reducing emissions of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases.\n\nStill, given the urgency of climate change, even a quick or partial fix \u2014 such as carbon capture \u2014 can\u2019t be ignored. \u201cAt this point in time,\u201d says Persson, \u201cwe need to look at all the possible solutions.\u201d And MXene-like materials are emerging as potentially important candidates."}, {"title": "Is Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense even trying to win?", "author": "Elizabeth Lopatto", "source": "The Verge", "published_at": "2023-10-04T23:02:14+00:00", "category": "technology", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23903986/sam-bankman-fried-opening-statements-trial-fraud", "body": "I have never seen Sam Bankman-Fried so still as he was during the prosecution\u2019s opening statement.

Instead, he punched hard on Bankman-Fried lying and stealing.\n\nBankman-Fried sat almost motionless, occasionally glancing at Rehn, as the prosecutor told the jury that Bankman-Fried sold stock in FTX and borrowed millions from lenders by lying.\n\nThe story Rehn told is familiar to anyone following the news. In May and June of 2022, Alameda Research \u2014 the crypto trading company ostensibly helmed by Caroline Ellison \u2014 didn\u2019t have enough to pay its bills, so it pulled customer money to repay loans. By September, the hole in the FTX balance sheet was so big that customers could never be repaid.\n\nFTX \u201cdidn\u2019t have a chief risk officer, which became an issue when the storm hit.\u201d\n\nWhen CoinDesk published its article in November 2022, people realized FTX was a house of cards, Rehn said. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried tweeted. \u201cFTX is fine. Assets are fine\u201d and \u201cWe don\u2019t invest customer assets even in treasuries.\u201d\n\nPointing at Bankman-Fried, Rehn said, \u201cThis man stole billions of dollars from thousands of people.\u201d\n\nSo how was the defense going to follow it up? I was very curious, having learned yesterday that Bankman-Fried had never been offered a plea deal since he and his attorneys had told the government they wouldn\u2019t negotiate. Surely there would be some manner of evidence, some something, that would have made him so confident.\n\nThere was, instead, a metaphor.\n\nDefense attorney Mark Cohen, with the energy of a patient father telling his obnoxious children a bedtime story, assured us that working at a startup was like building a plane while flying it, and that FTX the plane had flown right into the perfect storm: the crypto crash. Except, uh, he also said this: FTX \u201cdidn\u2019t have a chief risk officer, which became an issue when the storm hit.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the missing risk officer\n\nThe problem with this metaphor is that if FTX was a plane, it was a plane flying with a key component missing \u2014 namely, the risk officer, an executive whose job it is to, well, manage risk. This is sort of an important thing, as risks can be anything from reputational to regulatory to financial.\n\nFTX was named such as it was because it was a futures exchange, which, to borrow a phrase from Bloomberg\u2019s Matt Levine, \u201csits between the winners and losers of bets.\u201d That means FTX can\u2019t pay out what it owes the winners unless the losers pay up. Risk management is a crucial part of the business; risk officers exist to identify business\u2019 potential risks, monitor, and mitigate them. This is to say nothing of the regulatory risks around crypto.\n\nAs Cohen droned on about airplanes, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the missing risk officer. Bringing it up, I thought, was a tremendous mistake. The prosecution hadn\u2019t mentioned it. Either Bankman-Fried is stupid \u2014 unlikely \u2014 or he deliberately didn\u2019t hire a risk officer. Was he worried about what one might find?\n\nSure, as Cohen put it, Bankman-Fried was a math nerd who didn\u2019t party. That paints a picture of someone who\u2019s pretty deliberate, particularly since he immediately left MIT and went to work on Wall Street. If he had been a party-hardy trainwreck, I could see overlooking a risk officer in order to do another line, or a supermodel, or something else important. Why was the defense bringing this up?\n\nBut as Cohen tried to tell me that FTX\u2019s and Alameda\u2019s business relationships were \u201creasonable under the circumstances,\u201d the lack of risk officer kept elbowing me in the ribs. \u201cSam acted in good faith and took reasonable business measures\u201d is a pretty hard pill to swallow with that in mind.\n\nMan, it\u2019s no good when your defense lawyer has just made you sound worse than the prosecution already did. And while Cohen tried to make the common white-collar defense argument that Bankman-Fried, as CEO, was simply too busy to oversee what everyone did every day, he just made me more suspicious. That\u2019s why you hire a risk officer and delegate! That\u2019s the whole point! I could barely even hear Cohen blaming Caroline Ellison and Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao for the debacle over the \u201cno risk officer\u201d ringing in my ears.\n\nFollowing the defense\u2019s opening statements, things got still worse for Bankman-Fried. The prosecution called its first witness, Marc-Antoine Julliard, whose money got stuck on FTX. Juilliard, who was born in Paris and lives in London, testified that he trusted FTX because Bankman-Fried came across as a leading figure of the industry. When he was evaluating the exchange, he thought the sheer volume of users was important, too \u2014 at the time, FTX was among the top three biggest exchanges. Plus, major VC firms had invested, and \u201cthey don\u2019t commit hundreds of millions without doing due diligence, checking the books, the accountancy of the firm, going through several compliance process[es], so that was a vote of confidence for me,\u201d Juilliard said. (Evidently he had not paid attention to the Elizabeth Holmes trial.)\n\nHe also noted FTX\u2019s glossy ads \u2014 featuring Gisele B\u00fcndchen, for instance \u2014 suggested a very high budget. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to spend that much money unless FTX had very strong financials, Juilliard figured. He opened an account, transferred in both regular money and cryptocurrency, and used the exchange to execute his plan: buying Bitcoin to sell back in five to ten years at higher prices.\n\nIt is a thankless task to cross-examine a customer whose money is gone\n\nIn November 2022, things went bad for Julliard. He followed Bankman-Fried on Twitter, and read aloud the \u201cFTX is fine. Assets are fine\u201d tweets, along with \u201cFTX has enough to cover all client holdings. We don\u2019t invest client assets\u201d and a few others, which gave Julliard the impression that his money was there \u2014 the problem might have been technical (anti-spam measures) or regulatory. When he tried to get his money out on November 8th, it was too late. We saw screenshots of his withdrawal attempts: $20,000 USD and about 4 Bitcoin, which were worth about $20,000 at the time: about $100,000 money, inaccessible.\n\nIt is a thankless task to cross-examine a customer whose money is gone, but Cohen tried anyway. He noted that Julliard was a licensed commodities broker, who was trading in crypto because he didn\u2019t have to disclose it; that Julliard knew that crypto was new and risky, and that Julliard didn\u2019t review the terms of service agreement he\u2019d assented to when making his FTX account.\n\nWell, sure, but so what?\n\nThe next witness called was Bankman-Fried\u2019s former college (and FTX) roommate, Adam Yedidia, about whom I expect I will have much more to say tomorrow."}, {"title": "SBF Trial: The latest updates from the FTX collapse\u2019s courtroom drama", "author": "Morgan Little", "source": "TechCrunch", "published_at": "2023-10-06T17:22:02+00:00", "category": "technology", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/sbf-trial-the-latest-updates-from-the-ftx-collapses-courtroom-drama/", "body": "SBF trial: Everything to know from the FTX courtroom ahead of his testimony Sam Bankman-Fried is in court for alleged fraud and money laundering while leading crypto exchange FTX and sister company Alameda. Here\u2019s our latest coverage as the case nears its end.\n\nThe trial of Bankman-Fried, the former CEO and co-founder of collapsed crypto exchange FTX, is entering its next chapter as proceedings resume Thursday. As confirmed during a teleconference Wednesday, SBF will be taking the stand, along with a handful of other witnesses as the onus shifts toward the defense after the prosecution brought its case to its conclusion.\n\nAs former federal prosecutor Josh Naftalis told TechCrunch, SBF taking to the stand in his own trial is a \u201cHail Mary\u201d ahead of a verdict and potential sentencing for seven counts tied to fraud and money laundering.\n\n\u201cOnce it goes to cross[-examination], he doesn\u2019t get to say, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019\u201d Naftalis said. \u201cHe can\u2019t just walk out if he doesn\u2019t like how it\u2019s going.\u201d\n\n\n\nNaftalis spoke at length about what comes next in the trial, and addressed common misconceptions about the prosecution and defense in the latest episode of TechCrunch\u2019s Chain Reaction podcast, which you can listen to below, or on Apple Podcasts or Spotify.\n\nThe SBF trial is one of the biggest cases of its kind within the crypto space. Our resident crypto expert Jacquelyn Melinek has been on the ground at the trial since it started, and continues to cover the ins and outs of the proceedings. But the trial has been on pause from October 20 to today, so there\u2019s plenty to catch up on if you need a refresher ahead of it entering its final few phases.\n\nFor those in need of a total refresher on the case, her breakdown of how FTX went from the third-largest crypto exchange valued at a peak of $32 billion to bankruptcy will get you up to speed.\n\nYou can also follow along with her and the TechCrunch team\u2019s coverage in the Chain Reaction newsletter, which drops Thursdays at 12 p.m. PT, and the Chain Reaction podcast, which will hit your feed every Thursday.\n\nHow to follow the SBF trial\n\nThe trial kicked off with jury selection October 3. From there, access to the proceedings is limited, as no devices are allowed; reports are being physically put together within the courtroom (or sent to overflow rooms).\n\nBeyond our daily coverage, additional expertise and commentary will live on TechCrunch+. There, you can find stories like this in-depth breakdown of what to expect from both sides of the SBF case, where the prosecution and defense could gain ground or fall short in their arguments and what the takeaways were from the opening arguments.\n\nSBF trial: What we learned in week three\n\nThe third week of the trial featured a couple of noteworthy moments for the prosecution, including FTX\u2019s former general counsel Can Sun. He, like many of SBF\u2019s former colleagues, opted to cooperate with authorities and testified that SBF asked him to create a theoretical \u201clegal justification\u201d for the use of billions in consumer funds just days before FTX filed for bankruptcy.\n\nRobert Boroujerdi, managing director of the hedge fund Third Point, testified about his experience working with SBF and FTX, in a partnership that ultimately resulted in a $60 million investment and a lack of awareness about the special relationship between Alameda Research and FTX. Had he known of such a relationship, he testified that Third Point would not have invested in FTX in the first place.\n\nAnd earlier in the week, a University of Notre Dame professor who helped the government prosecution of Enron and WorldCom, Peter Easton, testified about what he uncovered after tracing the flow of billions of dollars between Alameda Research and FTX. Much of said funding came from customers, and Easton testified that he found that user deposits were used by both FTX and Alameda to purchase real estate, make investments or direct funding toward political causes and charities.\n\nSBF trial: What we learned in week two\n\nThe second week of the trial\u2019s standout testimony came from Alameda Research\u2019s former CEO Caroline Ellison, who claimed she took $14 billion from customers to repay debts to lenders, using them as a line of credit under the instruction of SBF. Ellison also went into detail about how a $2 billion venture fund, FTX Ventures, was funded by money that had previously been allocated to Alameda from third-party lenders.\n\nAnd though there are no charges of bribery in the case, Ellison also testified to paying Chinese officials $150 million to restore access to $1 billion in frozen trading accounts.\n\nSBF trial: What we learned in the week one\n\nAs expected, the opening statements in the SBF trial were spicy. The prosecution painted a picture of an empire \u201cbuilt on lies\u201d and made a point to show actual pictures of SBF alongside rich and powerful figures to illustrate the peak of his power and influence prior to FTX\u2019s implosion.\n\n\u201cThis man stole billions of dollars from thousands of people,\u201d prosecutor Thane Rehn told the court. \u201cHe defrauded sophisticated investors and lenders, and he emptied the accounts of ordinary customers, too. He bought himself wealth, power and influence.\u201d\n\nThe defense, on the other hand, depicted SBF and his colleagues as in over their heads, without ill-will as FTX collapsed around them.\n\n\u201cSam and his colleagues were building the plane as they were flying it,\u201d defense attorney Mark Cohen said. \u201cThey had to figure out how to navigate a world where they were running FTX, building out its systems, dealing with hacking threats, managing the credit risk of their customers, managing hundreds of employees, all while building up their actual exchange.\u201d\n\nRead a recap of the prosecution and defense\u2019s full arguments here.\n\nFTX\u2019s co-founder and CTO Gary Wang testified Thursday on the extent to which Alameda Research was used for whatever purposes he and SBF saw fit. The crypto trading firm, according to Wang, pulled funding directly from FTX customers, whose transactions would be funneled toward Alameda and then directed elsewhere.\n\nCheck here for our rundown of Wang\u2019s testimony so far, resulting from a guilty plea in December 2022.\n\nThursday also brought in testimony from Matt Huang, co-founder and managing partner at crypto investment firm Paradigm. That firm invested $278 million in FTX across 2021 and 2022, and is part of a class-action lawsuit accusing it and others of defrauding customers by promoting FTX.\n\nHis testimony centered around being left uninformed about FTX\u2019s utilization of customer money to keep the Alameda Research afloat, a practice that Huang says would have halted his involvement. The full breakdown of his testimony on his relationship with FTX, stretching back to 2019, can be found right here.\n\nWe also got a look at the composition of the SBF trial\u2019s jury, which ranges from a train conductor to a retired investment banker who attended Stanford University. You can listen to a special joint episode of our podcasts Equity and Chain Reaction to get a better sense of the vibe between the jurors and the rest of the court.\n\nFor a full rundown of our coverage of the SBF trial, check below:"}, {"title": "The 26 best Amazon Prime Day deals you can still shop for today", "author": "Engadget", "source": "Engadget", "published_at": "2023-10-12T15:44:16+00:00", "category": "technology", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/the-26-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-you-can-still-shop-for-today-154416960.html?src=rss", "body": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004.

If you were hoping to check off a few more names from your holiday gift list or buy something for yourself at a discount, see what remains on sale below. We combed through our coverage over the past few days to find the best of what's left. While Amazon has returned most of their own devices, like Echos and Kindles, back to their full prices, a handful of products from other brands like Google, Samsung and Anker, have maintained the lows they hit on Prime Day. Here are the best deals from Prime Big Deal Days that you can still get right now.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6\n\nThe new Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 went down to $269 for October Prime Day and it's still on sale. That's lowest price we've seen since it came out a few months ago. You can't get a better smartwatch than this one if you have an Android phone (bonus points if you have a Samsung phone), and it's smaller and lighter than previous versions. Samsung brought back the spinning bezel on the Classic version, which is which makes the software's UI easier to navigate, plus it has improved performance and updated health and fitness tracking tools.\n\nApple MacBook Air M2 (15-inch)\n\nPhoto by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M2) $1,049 $1,260 Save $211 The MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and this deal brings the entry-level 15-inch model back down to the best price we've seen. Other SKUs with more RAM and storage are also on sale. $1,049 at Amazon\n\nThe 15.3-inch version of Apple\u2019s MacBook Air is still down to $1,049 for an entry-level model with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. That matches the best price we\u2019ve seen and takes $250 off Apple\u2019s list price. The MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and we gave the 15-inch model a review score of 96 earlier this year, as it covers just about all of the things we look for in a quality mainstream notebook. Compared to the 13.6-inch version, it also includes a more powerful speaker system and a slightly upgraded GPU. The SSD in this base configuration is technically slower than the one in higher-capacity SKUs, but that shouldn\u2019t be a major problem unless you\u2019re looking to do more complex work. In general, you wouldn\u2019t buy the Air for things like high-res media editing, though its M2 chip is still plenty powerful for everyday tasks.\n\nIf you do need more storage space, the 512GB model with 8GB of RAM is on sale for a low of $1,249. Variants with double the RAM are up to $250 off as well. Meanwhile, the 13.6-inch MacBook Air isn\u2019t discounted on Amazon, but it\u2019s down to $899 at Best Buy. That\u2019s $200 off the notebook\u2019s list price.\n\nSony WF-1000XM5\n\nSony's WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds went down to $278 for Prime Day and are still going for that price today. That's a $22 discount and their best price yet. We think these are the best wireless earbuds on the market right now. Sony improved upon it's already remarkable buds with a more comfortable fit, better sound quality and features likes adaptive sound and Speak-to-Chat.\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K\n\nThe previous generation of Fire TV Stick 4K dropped to $23 for the sale and is one of the few Amazon devices still on sale. It has the same processor, RAM and storage as the standard Fire TV Stick, but it can stream 4K HDR content in all its glory. It also supports Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos, while a picture-in-picture live view feature can show you feeds from compatible security cameras right on your TV screen.\n\nDo note, though, that this is the previous model of the streaming stick. The newly refreshed Fire TV Stick 4K isn't sale but has a faster processor and supports Wi-Fi 6.\n\nAnker Soundcore Motion +\n\nOne of the top Bluetooth options in our speaker guide is Anker\u2019s Soundcore Motion +, which gives out good sound for its price point. The $100 MSRP is discounted to $70 if you clip the on-page copuon. That's a 30 percent discount and an all-time low. It has a bright and bassy output and offers EQ customization in the app. Plus it\u2019s water-resistant, so you can take it to the park or on a hike and share your good taste in music with whoever is nearby.\n\nHyperX Cloud Stinger 2\n\nThe top budget pick in our gaming headphones buying guide, the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2, is on sale for $36. That\u2019s a dollar more than it went for on Prime Day and only a modest $4 discount over its street price recently, but it's still close to lowest price we\u2019ve seen. The Cloud Stinger 2 doesn\u2019t have the most balanced or detailed sound, but its V-shaped signature gives action scenes a nice level of impact, and its mic quality belies the dirt-cheap price. The design is comfortable too, though it\u2019s made from cheap-feeling plastic.\n\nShokz OpenRun Pro\n\nThe Shokz OpenRun Pro is down to $125 for Prime Big Deal Days, which is $25 more than the lowest price we\u2019ve tracked but still $55 below its usual going rate. This is a recommended pair of bone conduction headphones, which means it hugs the side of your head and delivers sound by passing vibrations through your skull. (It\u2019s not as uncomfortable as it sounds.) The main benefit is that this leaves your ear canals completely open, so you can enjoy a playlist or podcast without being shut out from the outside world. The downside, usually, is that you don\u2019t get as full a sound as you would with a traditional pair. That\u2019ll still be the case here, but we\u2019ve found the OpenRun Pro to deliver more low-end depth than most of its peers. They\u2019re fairly comfy and get up to 10 hours of battery life beyond that.\n\nLogitech G535\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a wireless headset, the Logitech G535 is back down to $80, which is about $25 below its average street price. This is an honorable mention in our gaming headsets guide, as we like its lightweight design, Bluetooth support and agreeable, relatively well-balanced sound. It forces you to crank the volume to reach a listenable level though, and its mic makes voices sound a little too thin. It also doesn't work with Xbox consoles. But if you really want a wireless gaming headset for less than $100, it\u2019s well worth a look.\n\nSamsung Smart Monitor M8\n\nThe Samsung Smart Monitor M8 is down to just $500, which is $200 off its starting price (though it regularly sells for $600) and the lowest price we've seen thus far. This 32-inch display has built-in apps and allows you to access streaming services, just like you would on a smart TV. It can also act as a smart home hub, showing you your smart camera feeds and more. This discounted model is the updated 2023 version of the monitor that launched at CES 2022.\n\nGoogle Indoor Nest Security Cam\n\nA slew of Google Nest home security devices are still on sale the day after Prime, including the battery-powered Nest Cam that can go inside or outside your home. Typically priced at $180, the security cam dipped down to $120 for Amazon's October Prime Day event. The Nest Cam works with smart speakers and displays enabled with Alexa or the Google Assistant and can last up to seven months depending on how much activity it picks up. Its weather-resistant build and magnetic mount should make it easy to install on most surfaces. It sends live alerts to your phone and will even allow for on-demand check-ins without a subscription, though it only stores the last three hours for free. For six months of stored footage, you'll need a Nest Aware membership.\n\nGoogle Nest Thermostat\n\nGoogle Google Nest Thermostat $90 $130 Save $40 The Google Nest Thermostat lets you control your heating and cooling from anywhere and suggests tweaks to help you save money. This Black Friday deal takes $40 off the list price. $90 at Amazon\n\nIn other Google deals, the Nest Thermostat is on sale for just $90, which is only about $10 more than the lowest price we've tracked and $40 off Google's MSRP. This is Google's entry-level smart thermostat, but it still lets you control your heating and cooling from anywhere, suggests tweaks to help you save money, and in some cases, can entitle you to rebates from your utility provider. It's all relatively easy to program, and it works with Google's Nest Hub and other smart displays like the Echo Show.\n\nBeats Studio Pro\n\nThe Beats Studio Pro headphones are on sale for $180 right now. which is a dollar more than they sold for on Prime Day and still a sizable $170 discount. We reviewed these back in July when they came out and gave them a decent review score of 81. Unfortunately they didn't push any of the top picks from our our best headphones list off their pedestals. They aren't bad, however, offering pleasant, even-handed sound and good noise cancellation. Though Beats is now owned by Apple, these headphones still play nice with Android. There's no wear detection and the mostly plastic design isn\u2019t super premium, but at this price, you may not care.\n\nTribit StormBox Micro 2\n\nThe Tribit StormBox Micro 2 is another small speaker we like that puts out decent volume for its size, and for Prime day it went down to $48, which is $12 off its usual going rate. Right now it's on sale for $60, but an on-page 15 percent coupon brings it back to that Prime Day low. This device has a strap on its back that works well on belts, backpacks, or even bike handlebars, so it\u2019s easy to take on the road. And \"on the go\" is where the StormBox Micro 2 performs best, as it\u2019s more about portable volume than pure fidelity.\n\nGoogle Nest Wi-Fi Pro 6E\n\nThe Google Nest Wi-Fi Pro 6E is holding strong at $300 right now for a pack of three routers. That's within a dollar of the lowest price it's sold for on Amazon. It's one of the best Wi-Fi 6 router systems you can get at the moment thanks to its easy setup process, convenient Google Assistant integrations and Matter and Thread support. If you're looking for a not-too expensive way to upgrade your home Wi-Fi system, and one that will take little time to set up, Google's is the one to get.\n\nRoku Streaming Stick 4K\n\nOur favorite streaming stick, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K, remains at $37 after the sale. It packs a ton of features into an affordable package, including 4K HDR streaming capabilities, Dolby Vision, AirPlay 2 and private listening when you have a pair of headphones. And since it's so small, it makes for a great travel entertainment device too.\n\nHisense U6K\n\nThe Hisense U6K is one of the more affordable TVs. And the 55- and 65-inch models are still down to $400 and $548, respectively. We\u2019ve seen these deals before, but each matches an all-time low. The U6K is has received generally positive reviews around the web, as it's one of the few budget-level sets with quantum dots, full-array local dimming and a mini-LED backlight. All of that should help it deliver better contrast and color volume than most TVs in its price range. It\u2019s not ideal for gaming though, as it\u2019s limited to a 60Hz refresh rate and lacks HDMI 2.1 ports. In general, it can\u2019t match the brightness or viewing angles of a more expensive set, but it looks to be a good buy if you\u2019re on a tighter budget.\n\nFor a well-reviewed midrange model, the Hisense U8K provides much better contrast and peak brightness, plus more gaming-friendly features like ability to play 4K content at up to a 144Hz refresh rate. That one is down to $748 for a 55-inch model and $998 for a 65-inch set.\n\niRobot Roomba 694\n\niRobot's Roomba 694 dropped to $199 for Prime Day and stayed there. While that's still $20 more than the lowest we've seen it go, it's still a good deal on our favorite cheap robot vacuum. It's got strong suction power, an attractive design and easy to use app. It'll be a good option for robo-vac novices, or anyone that doesn't want to fuss too much with an automatic dirt sucker. It clears hard and carpeted floors well, and it automatically returns to its base once a cleaning job is finished so it can recharge.\n\nSamsung Pro Plus microSD\n\nThe Samsung Pro Plus microSD card is on sale for $20 right now. It's our top pick in our best microSD card guide because it was the most consistent of the ones we tested, with some of the best overall speeds and all of the important ratings that a good card should have: U3, V30 and A2. It'll be a great pick for your tablet, smartphone or Nintendo Switch, and it comes with a full-sized adapter in case you need to use it with a camera or connect it to your computer.\n\nCrucial MX500\n\nThe Crucial MX500 internal drive is on sale for $46 right now. It's been an Engadget favorite for a while thanks to its sequential read speeds of 560MB/s and a standard 2.5-inch design that should make it easy to swap in for your desktop's or laptop's used-up drive.\n\nOther great deals for after Prime Day\n\nAnker 511 Charger\n\nAnker 511 Charger (Nano 3) $20 $23 Save $3 See at Amazon\n\nNew Apple Watches don\u2019t come with power adapters, so if you\u2019re looking for one that can deliver a quick charge, we recommend Anker's 511 (Nano 3) charging brick. It\u2019s down to $20 which is a mild, $4 discount, but still a welcome price for a worthwhile smartwatch accessory.\n\nOtterBox Fast Charge Power Bank\n\nOtterBox Fast Charge Power Bank 15,000 mAh $36 $45 Save $9 See at Amazon\n\nThe OtterBox Fast Charge Power Bank is currently just $36 for the 15,000mAh capacity model, which is the version we tested and recommend in our portable battery guide. This pack looks sharp and delivers a fast and reliable charge via USB-C or USB-A.\n\nSanDisk 128GB microSDXC Card for Nintendo Switch\n\nSanDisk 128GB microSDXC-Card Licensed for Nintendo-Switch $18 $31 Save $13 See at Amazon\n\nIf you need more room on your Switch, SanDisk's officially licensed microSDXC card is a good pick, particularly when it\u2019s on sale.

He introduced a way to put cranberries in a can in 1912.\n\nCranberries are one of the few fruits native to the northern United States.

He attended the University of Maine, where he became an undergraduate scholar of great renown and great vision.\n\nHe was apparently aware of the gift of his intellect at a young age. He was also raised to believe, or grew to believe by college, that those born with great gifts were also born with great responsibility to the nation.\n\nHe founded a society of elite students at the University of Maine to charge the school's best and brightest with using their intellect for the wider good.\n\nIt's known today as Phi Kappa Phi, a nationwide honor society of the nation's best students.\n\n\"An analysis of the men in my class convinced me that some of our brightest men were in danger of contributing less to society \u2026 than their ability justified.\" \u2014 Marcus Urann\n\n\"Under the leadership of student Marcus L.

But in 1906, he decided to give it up to buy cranberry bogs in and around Cape Cod and Plymouth.\n\n'Simple, insignificant-looking plant\u2019\n\nPilgrim Edward Winslow provided our only contemporary account of the first Thanksgiving. He mentions only fowl and deer, and \"our harvest being gotten in.\"\n\nThe harvest certainly included corn, scholars believe.\n\nThe rest of the \"harvest\" upon which they feasted is unknown.\n\n\"But there is no evidence the Pilgrims had cranberries at the first Thanksgiving,\" said Wick of Massachusetts Cranberries, despite the fact they are one of the few fruits native to North America that grow in the northern United States.\n\nIt might have just been overlooked \u2014 as authors Cox and Walker suspect.\n\n\"There is no evidence the Pilgrims had cranberries at the first Thanksgiving.\" \u2014 Brian Wick\n\nThey cite colonial settler John Josselyn, who wrote in 1672 that the cranberry is nothing but \"a small trailing plant\" and a humble vine \"that grows over Salt Marshes that are overgrown with moss.\"\n\nBenjamin Eastwood, touted by Cox and Walker as one of the cranberry\u2019s \"greatest promoters,\" spoke only in humble terms of his beloved fruit.\n\nHe called the cranberry a \"simple, insignificant-looking plant\" and a \"stunted barren thing.\"\n\nUrann saw the cranberry differently. He saw a global industry crawling along the bogs of Massachusetts.\n\n\"After he set up cooking facilities at a packinghouse in Hanson, Massachusetts, he began to consider ways to extend the short selling season of the berries,\" Smithsonian Magazine reported in a 2013 history of cranberries.\n\nMEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED THE SHOPPING CART, SYLVAN GOLDMAN, OKLAHOMA SUPERMARKET MOGUL\n\n\"Canning them, in particular, he knew would make the berry a year-round product.\"\n\nIn 1912, Urann began processing gelled cranberries in cans \u2014 cranberry sauce.\n\n\"As modest as this seems, Urann's maneuver was revolutionary,\" write Cox and Walker. \"For a fruit that had been marketed almost exclusively as a fresh product, it was a radical proposal to cook and to can.\"\n\nMost importantly, cranberries could now be sold to consumers far from where they were grown.\n\nUrann pioneered other innovations in cranberry farming, too, including the process of wet-harvesting cranberries.\n\n\"For a fruit that had been marketed almost exclusively as a fresh product, it was a radical proposal to cook and to can.\"\n\nThe tiny berries were usually plucked from dried vines by migrant workers. But cranberries, each filled with four chambers of air, float easily.\n\nUrann realized the bog could be floated, the berries agitated from their vines, and easily rounded up while floating in the water.\n\nUrann teamed up with fellow leaders of cranberry farming John Makepeace and Elizabeth Lee to create Ocean Spray, still headquartered in Massachusetts to this day.\n\nThe name is synonymous with cranberry juice and cranberry sauce.\n\nOcean Spray is one of the world's most successful farming cooperatives. It's helped spread cranberry farming around the country and around the world \u2014 and put cranberry juices and sauces in international markets.\n\nOcean Spray cranberry sauce remains its signature product. The company first sold its cranberry sauce nationally in 1941 \u2014 its ridged cranberry gel a familiar site on Thanksgiving tables around the United States.\n\n\u2018Everything in life is what you do for others'\n\nMarcus L. Libby died on April 1, 1963 in Hanson, Massachusetts, where he rests in a family plot in Fernhill Cemetery.\n\n\"I do believe that anyone can do anything that he really desires to accomplish,\" Urann wrote as a young man 1924, explaining the history of Phi Kappa Phi.\n\nHe lived by that example throughout his life.\n\n\"A recognized giant of the cranberry industry,\" The Boston Globe wrote in his April 4 obituary, dubbing Urann the \"Cranberry King.\"\n\n\"He bought his first cranberry bog on [Cape Cod] in 1906.

Now a panel of judges has ruled that more than 80 cases can be consolidated into federal court.\n\nThe stakes are high for both parties with implications extending to future Uber riders and drivers. The outcome of the case could result in sweeping changes to Uber\u2019s platform, which plaintiffs argue will reduce sexual assault and also raise new concerns over privacy.\n\nThe upshot? Technology lies at the center of this very human story.\n\nUber has attempted to address sexual assaults by drivers \u2014 which the lawsuits claim Uber has known about since 2014 \u2014 through new safety features in its app, like a 911 button and the ability to share location with a friend. Yet survivors, and their attorneys, say that response has been inadequate, and they\u2019re calling for better technological solutions like in-vehicle surveillance cameras.\n\nAside from the 911 button and location-sharing feature, which were both introduced in 2018, Uber has added other features to the app over the last five years. In 2021, Uber introduced a feature that allows riders and drivers to record audio during a trip. The following year, Uber launched a pilot to provide passengers with live help from an ADT safety agent, as well as PIN verifications to ensure passengers are connected to the correct driver.\n\nRachel Abrams \u2014 a sexual assault attorney and partner at law firm Peiffer Wolf Carr Kane Conway & Wise, one of the law firms working on the multidistrict litigation, who filed the petition to consolidate the various actions in federal court \u2014 argues the app-based solutions are half-measures that haven\u2019t quelled instances of sexual violence against passengers on the platform. Mandatory in-vehicle cameras in Uber cars is \u201cessential for safety,\u201d she says.\n\nUber told TechCrunch it cannot comment on pending litigation but said it remains committed to the safety of all users on its platform.\n\nIn-vehicle cameras as a deterrent\n\nAbrams cited data from studies of taxis equipped with in-vehicle cameras, which she says has drastically reduced instances of sexual assaults against passengers, as well as assault of passengers against drivers.\n\n\u201cThese are predatory, opportunistic drivers taking advantage of vulnerable women, so if they\u2019re on film, they likely wouldn\u2019t commit the crime,\u201d Abrams told TechCrunch.\n\nUber didn\u2019t respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for more information about why it hasn\u2019t mandated the use of cameras in ride-hail vehicles, but as with any surveillance, there are privacy issues. The legality of mandating cameras also varies across local and state laws.\n\nAbrams has her own theory as to why Uber has been slow to implement security cameras.\n\n\u201cCost isn\u2019t the issue,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that it would deter drivers because a lot of drivers don\u2019t want cameras. And so if they don\u2019t have drivers, they don\u2019t make money.\u201d\n\nMany drivers install their own dash cams to record trips, usually as backup evidence for insurance claims or to defend themselves against unfair deactivations from Uber\u2019s platform. Uber is also piloting a new video recording feature for drivers that allows them to record video on their smartphones. But in those cases, the driver can decide what and when to record, and when to share that data.\n\nOther demands\n\nThe survivors in the joined lawsuit also allege that Uber\u2019s \u201cfast and shallow background checks\u201d are substandard and designed to make it as easy as possible for drivers to sign up quickly. Uber uses third-party companies like Checkr and Appriss to do background checks, which Sergio Avedian, senior contributor at The Rideshare Guy, says \u201care at best watered down and not guaranteed of bad apples from falling through the cracks.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit calls on Uber to also include fingerprinting, which would run prospective drivers through FBI databases.\n\n\u201cThis is a very intentional and deliberate decision as evidenced by Uber\u2019s active lobbying and resistance against municipalities and regulatory bodies implementing any kind of biometric fingerprinting requirements for drivers,\u201d said Kevin Conway, managing partner at Peiffer Wolf Carr Kane Conway & Wise.\n\nUber has lobbied against additional background requirements for drivers, which has given the company authority to conduct its own background checks with little or no oversight, unlike most taxi operators.\n\nUber and Lyft say smudged fingerprints can lead to inaccurate results and that fingerprint checks reference historical arrest records, which can have discriminatory effects on some minority communities that face disproportionately high arrest rates. An Uber spokesperson told CNN arrest records are incomplete and often lack information about whether a person has been convicted of a crime.\n\nAside from in-vehicle surveillance and more extensive background checks, the survivors are asking Uber to implement driver training on interactions with passengers, a zero-tolerance policy for drivers, sexual harassment education and training, and a more adequate system to encourage customer reporting and monitor customer complaints.\n\nAre Uber\u2019s in-app safety features working?\n\nAbrams argues that Uber\u2019s safety features are insufficient because they\u2019re all app-based and only potentially useful if a rider has access to their own phone.\n\n\u201cThe majority of clients I represent and the women I\u2019ve spoken to who have been sexually assaulted have experienced: (A) someone else ordered the ride for them; (B) their phone is dead or they can\u2019t locate their phone to use the safety shield; or (C) if they could use their phone, they\u2019re incapacitated,\u201d said Abrams.\n\nThe lawyer says she has interviewed upward of 5,000 survivors over the course of several years and has seen no difference in the number of attacks before or after implementation of these in-app features.\n\nUber hasn\u2019t released safety data for 2021 and 2022, and won\u2019t say when it plans to do so. Older data backs up some of Abrams\u2019 claims.\n\nUber has published two safety reports \u2014 one containing data from 2017 to 2018 and another with data from 2019 to 2020. The ride-hail company claims that the rate of sexual assault reported on the app decreased 38% between its first and second reports.\n\nWhile the rate decrease is positive, not all the data delivers the same message. Over that same time period, the total number of sexual assault reports across five categories fell from 5,981 to 3,824. That drop could be explained by the decrease of trips from 1.4 billion in 2019 to 650 million in 2020.\n\nAnd while the total number of incidents as a percentage of total number of rides does decrease through the years, the number of incidents in certain categories actually increases. The number of incidents increased in the categories of nonconsensual kissing, nonconsensual touching and nonconsensual penetration, or rape, between 2017 and 2019.\n\nThe total number of rape incidents also rose from 2017 to 2019. And while the number of reported rapes dropped in 2020, the rate has remained the same since 2017. In other words, there has not been an improvement in the rate of rapes on the platform.\n\nSexual assaults are an ongoing problem for Uber\n\nUber has been sued numerous times over the past few years by passengers who claim they were sexually assaulted during a ride. Lyft has faced similar lawsuits and accusations.\n\nUnder Uber\u2019s terms of use, class action lawsuits can\u2019t be filed against the company in cases of sexual assault, so each case has to be heard individually. This has prevented survivors from advocating for themselves collectively.\n\nJudge Charles Breyer in the Northern District of California will preside over pretrial hearings. This will be the first time a federal judge is able to make decisions for a large amount of these cases, which will streamline the proceedings. Breyer may preside over the trials depending on whether the parties agree. If the parties do not agree to have Judge Breyer preside of the case for trial, the cases go back to their home jurisdiction for trial.\n\nAnother consolidated lawsuit has also been filed against Uber in California, but it only covers survivors in that state.\n\nUber has attempted, through several filings for motions to dismiss, to stop the consolidation of these cases. It argues that the company did not owe a duty to the plaintiffs to protect against criminal conduct. Lawyers representing the survivors will have to prove that Uber owed a duty of care to passengers, including the duty of taking reasonable precautions to ensure their safety.\n\nThe pretrial matters, including witness and expert depositions and document discovery, will be heard by Judge Charles Breyer. Abrams expects the timeline of the proceedings to last over the next one to two years."}, {"title": "Jada Pinkett Smith reveals why she and Will Smith never signed a prenup", "author": "Amber Raiken", "source": "The Independent - Life and Style", "published_at": "2023-10-16T15:48:10+00:00", "category": "entertainment", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/jada-pinkett-will-smith-prenup-b2430529.html", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

While discussing her new memoir, Worthy, Jada revealed that she and Will didn\u2019t sign a prenup when they were married in 1997 because they knew divorce wasn\u2019t in the cards for them.\n\n\u201cListen, weddings are beautiful, but they can be very romanticised,\u201d Jada said. \u201cI feel that was a very real moment for the two of us to look each other in the eyes, recognise that there would be tough times in this journey and to say to each other: \u2018No matter what, we\u2019re going to figure it out and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t need a prenup, because I\u2019m making a promise that divorce won\u2019t be necessary, that we will figure this out.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Girls Trip star explained how she and Will casually promised not to get a divorce, and how that decision impacted their perspective on on marriage.\n\n\u201cAnd we made that promise to each other without all of the bridal wedding beauty; it was just sitting on a log in his mother\u2019s backyard, and going: \u2018Hey\u2019 - having to really look at the possibility of us not being together,\u201d she said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Jada has opened up about her long-term commitment to her husband. During an interview with Hoda Kotb for Today, which aired on 13 October, the actor confirmed that she and her partner have been living \u201ccompletely separate lives\u201d for the past seven years. However, according to Jada, their choice to live in separate homes doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll be getting divorced anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will work through whatever. And I just haven\u2019t been able to break that promise.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why she and Will didn\u2019t \u201cjust amicably divorce,\u201d Jada simply replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nShe then explained how her family shaped that decision, as she and the King Richard star share two children - Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22. Will also has a 30-year-old son, Trey, who he shares with ex-wife Sheree Zampino. \u201cWe love our family and we love each other. It\u2019s more of a life partnership,\" Jada explained. \"Now, 10 years from now, Hoda, who knows?\u201d\n\nDuring a 2018 episode of her Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk, Jada doubled down on her stance about divorce, as she recalled the the hard conversation she had with Will about the topic before they got married.\n\n(Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI told Will from the gate, I said let me tell you something: \u2018If you marry me, know this: we\u2019re gonna be together. We\u2019re going to be under the same roof,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cFor me personally, I\u2019m not mature enough to have a divorce, I\u2019m just not. I don\u2019t think I would ever be mature enough, I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star has also shared similar sentiments, as he said during an appearance on the Ellen Degeneres Show that \u201cdivorce just can\u2019t be an option\u201d for him and Jada. \u201cIt\u2019s really that simple. And I think that\u2019s the problem with LA - there are so many options. So a huge part of the success for [Jada] and I is that we just removed the other options.\u201d\n\nLast week, Jada made headlines when she revealed that at the time of the 2022 Academy Awards, when Will slapped Chris Rock, she and her husband had been separated for six years. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,\u201d she said during an interview with People. \u201cWe just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.\u201d\n\nJada then praised her children for how they\u2019ve helped her grow, adding: \u201cMy children, they\u2019re little gurus. They\u2019ve taught me a deep sense of self-acceptance.\u201d\n\nOn 16 October, Will broke his silence on his wife\u2019s comments during an interview with the New York Times. The outlet noted that he said his partner\u2019s memoir \u201ckind of woke him up\u201d and that he has now realised she is more \u201cresilient, clever and compassionate than he\u2019d understood\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been with someone for more than half of your life, a sort of emotional blindness sets in, and you can all too easily lose your sensitivity to their hidden nuances and subtle beauties,\u201d Will added."}, {"title": "Theatre producer and Everton chairman Kenwright dies", "author": null, "source": "BBC News - Entertainment & Arts", "published_at": "2023-10-24T16:32:09+00:00", "category": "entertainment", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/67203234?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "body": "Last updated on .From the section Everton\n\nBill Kenwright became Everton chairman in 2004\n\nEverton chairman Bill Kenwright, an acclaimed West End theatre and film producer, has died at the age of 78.\n\nKenwright had surgery to remove a cancerous tumour from his liver eight weeks ago.\n\nHe had been on the board at Everton since 1989, taking over as chairman at Goodison Park in 2004.\n\nThe Liverpudlian was also one of the UK's most successful theatre producers and played Gordon Clegg in Coronation Street between 1968 and 2012.\n\nKenwright was awarded a CBE for his services to film and theatre in the 2001 New Years Honours List.\n\nEverton said it was \"in mourning\" following the death of the club's longest-serving chairman for more than a century.\n\n\"The club has lost a chairman, a leader, a friend, and an inspiration,\" Everton added.\n\nOn 12 October, the Premier League club said Kenwright had a cancerous tumour removed from his liver six weeks before.\n\nEverton said the operation was \"completely successful\", but complications meant Kenwright required a \"prolonged period in an intensive care unit\".\n\nAnnouncing his death on Tuesday, Kenwright's family said he \"passed away peacefully\" on Monday night \"surrounded by his family and loved ones\".\n\n\"Bill was driven by his passions and devoted his life to them; his deep love of theatre, film, music and his beloved Everton, and the families they created,\" a family statement read.\n\n\"He impacted the lives of thousands, whether that be through the launching of careers or his unending loyalty, generosity and unfaltering friendship and support.\"\n\nIn a multiple award-winning career spanning six decades, Kenwright produced more than 500 West End, Broadway, UK touring and international theatre productions, films and music albums.\n\n\"We will remember him with huge love and admiration - the shows will of course go on, as he would have wished, and his towering legacy will continue,\" his family added.\n\nLeading Everton for almost two decades\n\nKenwright spent 19 seasons as Everton chairman, overseeing 12 finishes inside the Premier League top eight, including fourth place in 2005, while the Merseyside club were also FA Cup finalists in 2009.\n\nEverton said he had led the club through \"a period of unprecedented change in English football\".\n\nIn February 2016, Kenwright sold a 49.9% stake in the club to Iranian businessman Farhad Moshiri, who increased his shares to 94% in January 2022.\n\nBut with the club fighting against relegation last season, an Everton fans' group called for Kenwright to be sacked and said it had \"no confidence\" in him as chairman.\n\nKenwright and the rest of the board of directors were unable to attend home games last season from January after what the club described as \"threatening correspondence\" was received before a game against Southampton.\n\nChief executive Denise Barrett-Baxendale, chief finance and strategy officer Grant Ingles and non-executive director Graeme Sharp have all since left their boardroom roles, but Kenwright remained in his post as chairman until his death.\n\nIn September, owner Moshiri agreed to sell his 94% stake to American investment fund 777 Partners.\n\nThe club said Kenwright had \"worked hard\" alongside Moshiri \"right up until the day\" of his liver operation to help facilitate the proposed takeover.\n\nMoshiri said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the death of his \"great friend\".\n\n\"Bill was a force of nature and he certainly changed my life nearly 10 years ago when he first spoke to me about getting involved with the club he adored,\" said Moshiri.\n\n\"He told me about this incredible club, a club that not only has history and heritage but was also a beating heart of our community and for that I will always be grateful.\n\n\"He was a special soul, a man successful in so many different walks of life. We will miss him but never forget him.\"\n\nFrom the cobbles to the director's box\n\nKenwright started his career as an actor and landed his breakthrough role in ITV soap opera Coronation Street in 1968 as Gordon, the son of long-serving Rovers Return barmaid Betty.\n\nHe left Weatherfield the following year, but appeared back on screen with occasional visits over the subsequent decades.\n\nKenwright also began putting on plays in order to give himself roles and discovered he had an aptitude for pulling the strings behind the scenes.\n\nHe found big success by staging new productions of two musicals - Willy Russell's Blood Brothers and Andrew Lloyd-Webber and Tim Rice's Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat - and making them long-running touring hits.\n\nHe has also staged productions of The Shawshank Redemption, The Exorcist, Cabaret, Evita, Saturday Night Fever and The Sound of Music.\n\nAmong his current shows, Sir Ian McKellen is starring in Frank and Percy in London, while Twelve Angry Men, Calendar Girls The Musical, Heathers The Musical and Blood Brothers are all on tour.\n\nDame Judi Dench, Woody Harrelson, Billie Piper, Rob Lowe and Felicity Kendal have also starred in his productions.\n\nRooney leads tributes to a 'big inspiration'\n\nWayne Rooney, former Everton and England forward: \"Devastated to hear the sad news about Bill Kenwright. Known Bill since I was young and he's had a huge impact on me as a person and my career. Great man and a big inspiration. Thoughts are with all Bill's family and friends.\"\n\nJamie Carragher, ex-Liverpool and England defender: \"Really sad news this. A huge Evertonian who served and loved his club to bits. I'll never forget his and Everton's support every year around the Hillsborough memorial. RIP Bill.\"\n\nAndy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester and Everton fan: \"It does feel like the end of an era, Bill was a big-hearted person. Such generosity and backed so many people that needed help, perhaps people did not see that in the media.\n\n\"He had a deep love for his club and the city he was from, it is an emotional night.\"\n\nActor Sir Ian McKellen: \"Like many grateful actors I am in debt to Bill Kenwright for employment.

As they come of age and spring approaches, it\u2019s time for them to begin their journey to chase that dream. After saying goodbye to their mother and hometown, adventure awaits. They open the front door and take their first steps into a world full of new experiences and things to uncover.\n\nThat\u2019s right: it\u2019s time to enter the workforce!\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon that existed when Game Freak and series creator Satoshi Tajiri kick-started a phenomenon in 1996, and the one that premiered its first live-action TV series in Japan with Pack Your Pocket With Adventure (Pocket ni Bouken o Tsumekonde, or Pok\u00e9Tsume for short) last month, are almost unrecognizable. Which makes sense when you go from creating a game in a home office to a franchise more lucrative than the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Harry Potter, and Nintendo\u2019s own Mario combined.\n\nMore than 25 years since the original game\u2019s release, multiple generations of kids have become adults under the watchful eyes of Pikachu and friends, and the series has grown to encompass everything from anime and merchandise to card games and Hollywood blockbusters. Perhaps most surprisingly of all, with the growth in popularity of trading card games like Pok\u00e9mon in a postpandemic world and the record-breaking sales of the recent generation of titles despite quality concerns, it only seems to get more popular by the year.\n\nFor a franchise to retain relevance for as long as Pok\u00e9mon, it must evolve \u2014 and not just evolve but interweave its ideals into the fabric of daily life. Those early generations of kids need to pass on their love of Pok\u00e9mon like how Disney animated classics often serve as a formative childhood introduction to film.\n\nPerhaps nothing encapsulates Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s successful transformation from video game to a way of life quite like Pok\u00e9Tsume.\n\nPok\u00e9Tsume. Image: TV Tokyo\n\nBut what even is Pok\u00e9Tsume? Prior to the premiere of the series in Japan last month, there had only been one prior attempt at live-action storytelling within the world of Pok\u00e9mon: 2019\u2019s Detective Pikachu. Unlike Ryan Reynolds\u2019 wisecracking gumshoe Pikachu, Pok\u00e9Tsume was the first Japanese live-action foray into Pok\u00e9mon and doesn\u2019t even take place within the universe of the games.\n\nIn this series, we follow Madoka Akagi, portrayed by popular Japanese idol Nanase Nishino of Nogizaka46, a recent graduate moving out of her childhood home to live in the city and follow her dream of becoming a creator with an upstart company called ADventure. She played Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue (Red and Green in Japan) when she was a kid but has long since grown distant from the franchise.\n\nIllustration by Sarah Oh / The Verge Read next: Pok\u00e9mon Sleep helped me catch \u2019em all \u2014 all the z\u2019s, that is\n\nMuch of the opening episode of the series plays out as a nostalgic parallel between the trials of working life and the journey to become a Pok\u00e9mon Master. The childhood friend who works for another company is your rival. The product presentation to an investment CEO with the company\u2019s status on the line is a gym battle.\n\nShe rediscovers Pok\u00e9mon in a box of items sent from her mother and begins to replay this formative adventure; there are clips of the game or shots where we see the joy on the faces of both child and adult Madoka from the dim glow of the Game Boy screen. Pok\u00e9mon love even intertwines with the music scoring the series: a relaxing bar plays a slow jazz-infused rendition of the Pok\u00e9mon Center theme, just like how a synth rendition of Pallet Town marks the start of Madoka\u2019s journey.\n\nAs the show develops, the lessons from the game form the basis of a pseudo-episodic tale about Madoka\u2019s life at the company. The struggle to connect with a new client is paralleled by the way pok\u00e9mon won\u2019t listen to you until you\u2019ve proven your worth with gym badges. Learning and improving on the job is the experience that turns a flailing, floundering Magikarp into a job-leading Gyarados. And so on.\n\nThe show can come across a bit silly in places, and it struggles with communicating itself by making its Pok\u00e9mon overlay at times difficult to take seriously. But there\u2019s heart: there are plenty of touches that represent a series made with love, such as how characters have their own sprites integrated into the gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon Red.\n\nWith Pok\u00e9Tsume, Pok\u00e9mon isn\u2019t just a virtual journey to become a champion. It\u2019s a lesson we take with us into our daily lives long after our adventure is at an end. It\u2019s an integration of the morals of the franchise into our daily lives that epitomizes a 15-year transformation of the Pok\u00e9mon brand.\n\nThe 2021 remake of Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl. Image: Nintendo\n\nTo understand this, we must first cast an eye back to 2006. During the preparation for the launch of Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl for the Nintendo DS, developer Game Freak found the series at a crossroads. Sales had been on a steady decline since the original release, with the Hoenn GBA games at the time holding the distinction as the worst-selling mainline titles in the series. The reality was that the original generation of players had graduated from playing Pok\u00e9mon, and new generations simply weren\u2019t interested. Something had to change.\n\nIn response, the company launched the Japan-only Pok\u00e9mon Garden via the country\u2019s online Yahoo! Kids portal, an interactive experience taking you on a live tour through the history of Pok\u00e9mon, featuring mini-games and new information on the yet to be released Diamond and Pearl. Over 5 million unique users accessed Yahoo! Kids every month at this time, all within the series\u2019 core target demographic. In the end, the project proved successful, with Diamond and Pearl selling one-third more copies than its predecessors Ruby and Sapphire before eventually eclipsing the lifetime sales of those titles.\n\nNotably, at the time, it was one of the company\u2019s biggest attempts at diversifying the brand since its initial launch. Following the initial multimedia blitz, and the introduction of a World Championships and competitive circuit for the video games and TCG, the series remained relatively static. At this point, Pok\u00e9mon was yet to truly experiment with online distribution and promotion, nor had attempts been made to branch out beyond the series\u2019 core audience and multimedia properties following the initial surge in popularity.\n\nAs such, Pok\u00e9mon Garden was the first real attempt at expanding the core experience of Pok\u00e9mon to other platforms and audiences. While it\u2019s easy to mark 2016\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Go as the key turning point for Pok\u00e9mon in its appeal to older demographics \u2014 and it certainly was significant \u2014 the framework for this success was paved far earlier by experiments in diversifying what Pok\u00e9mon could be, whether that be through experiences like Garden or the transformation of the anime to tell a greater array of stories within this ever-expanding universe.\n\nFor the first time, external partners were being brought in to expand the world of Pok\u00e9mon beyond Ash Ketchum. OLM, long-term Pok\u00e9mon animation studio since 1998, passed the baton to other studios with the production of a spinoff series: Pok\u00e9mon Origins. While the studio did assist in production and animated the finale for the four-episode series, the rest of production was a collaborative effort led by Production I.G and Xebec, and proved to be a hit with audiences craving something new from the world of Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Concierge. Image: Netflix\n\nThis was just the beginning. Since then, no fewer than six unique web series have been produced by various external partners from around the world, each set in different regions within the world of Pok\u00e9mon. The most recent of these, this summer\u2019s Path to the Peak, was unique for taking place in the real world with a focus on the experience of competing in the TCG. Meanwhile, the upcoming Netflix series Pok\u00e9mon Concierge is another unique addition to this ever-expanding animation portfolio, marking the franchise\u2019s series debut in stop motion.\n\nThis is on top of a slew of one-off short films and music videos as well as a refocus of priorities for the long-running movie franchise. In 2017, the annual film franchise abandoned continuity with the TV anime in order to tell its own original stories without being confined by external events, allowing them to experiment with CG animation, remake the early episodes of the Pok\u00e9mon TV series in movie form, and allow Wit Studio, animators on the original series Attack on Titan, to helm their own movie with 2018\u2019s The Power of Us.\n\nThe company did more than simply introduce dynamism into an anime that had long since gone stale in the eyes of many. Greater efforts were made to integrate Pok\u00e9mon into the lives of communities in Japan and further afield, both through relief efforts and merchandising campaigns that provided more than toys and light relief to an aging audience.\n\nFollowing the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku and Fukushima, The Pok\u00e9mon Company joined many others in rushing to the aid of those affected. These efforts led to the establishment of the Pok\u00e9mon With You Foundation, aiming to provide support for disadvantaged communities even beyond this initial tragedy, expanding to everything from providing free educational materials and food drives for struggling children to funding scholarships. This was soon followed by partnerships with local governments across Japan for tourism initiatives, seen everywhere from Yokohama\u2019s yearly Pikachu Outbreak to the Pok\u00e9mon Local Acts initiative, which loans pok\u00e9mon out to flog local delicacies and hotspots, while serving as the origin of the country\u2019s charming Pok\u00e9mon-themed manhole covers.\n\nPikachu appears on a manhole cover in Yokohama.

Many of the 10-year-olds who played the initial games were now adults with families of their own. This led to the launch of monpoke, a special line of Pok\u00e9mon-themed items for infants, as well as the now-discontinued Pok\u00e9mon Shirts, which sold button-up shirts and formal workwear based on various pok\u00e9mon.\n\nWith each of these efforts, alongside the launch of Pok\u00e9mon Go \u2014 which gave lapsed older audiences an accessible reentry point that could fit around their busy schedules \u2014 the franchise was suddenly less of a gaming curio and more an ingrained facet of modern life.\n\nBy the time the 2023 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships rolled around, the first to be held in Japan in Yokohama, the aforementioned Pikachu Outbreaks were transformed into a city-wide takeover. Beyond the competition and Pikachu marches were drone shows, pop-up Pok\u00e9mon Centers, an orchestral concert, an entire cruise ship transformed into the SS Anne, food collaborations, photo spots, station takeovers, and more. Yokohama felt less like a typical Japanese city and more like a location ripped directly from the world of Pok\u00e9mon itself. Within all that were families, often two or three generations, sharing in a mutual love of Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. In recent years The Pok\u00e9mon Company has recorded record profits and revenue, while the games, anime, and TCG are more popular than ever, with both new mainline Switch entries selling over 20 million copies. The phenomenon of growing out of Pok\u00e9mon is no longer a concern. Even if young kids stop playing the video games as they grow, that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t still engage with this world via other means. Nor does it mean they won\u2019t introduce their own children to the series in the future.\n\nPok\u00e9Tsume is a series that\u2019s only possible because of a reinvention of what Pok\u00e9mon can be. While, in reality, it\u2019s a mostly light, inoffensive promotional tool to sell games (it\u2019s no coincidence the second episode has a scene of a young kid playing the latest entries in the series on his Nintendo Switch), it represents everything the franchise has aimed to be in recent years. Rather than a series for children, Pok\u00e9mon now promises something for everyone. And those new adults seeking direction in life might find a fellow directionless 20-something employee more relatable than a kid wanting to be a Pok\u00e9mon Champion. Frankly, it\u2019s a way to see they aren\u2019t alone, no different from how your party of pok\u00e9mon kept you company through the deepest caverns of Mt. Moon."}]
